            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the general, may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the peruſal of thoſe who, knowing their Obligation, better than they are acquainted with its diſcharge, may perhaps be perſwaded, at laſt, to be inſtrumental in our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement and Peace; nor of ſuch alſo

Nothing is deſigned derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Grandeur, or to detract from Authority even in little Towns; but all to eſtabliſh Empire and Power, in juſt and equal ſubordination. There are ſome Expreſsions jocular, and merry, to render the peruſal more pleaſant: (and it is no wonder to ſee Paſsion kindled in ſo large a Diſcourſe, where the concerns of both Parties ſeemed ſo great.) But yet it is hoped none that may give juſt offenſe to any that is faithful, either to his Prince or Religion. Though the Vicar, by reaſon of his

Poverty, and dependence, is forced to an high Conteſt with the Alderman, before he can obtain the liberty of his diſcourſe; yet what urbanity or ſubmiſsion is deficient in his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is abundantly made up by the modeſty of his deportment: Nor would you at all wonder at the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Language, if you knew either the Actors, or the Scene, all, alike, mean, and obſcure: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of the match is only in this, that the Alderman is too big and weighty for the Vicar, and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, again, too nimble for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman, both proportionable to their Table, and Revenue.</p>

                  <hi>You are a Perſon, Sir, ſo meek, and humble, that indeed the Corporation have as great an eſteem for you, as for any man that has been in the Town within my remembrance. For ſometimes we have had thoſe, who have been ſo ſtubborn, and ſelf-will'd, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly proud, that they have made no more reckoning of the Mayor and Aldermen, than if they had Country Gentlemen to deal with; that would paſs along with little ſalute, unleſs we quite put off our Grandeur, and diſpenſed with all gravity and decorum, in moving our Hats to them again. And (as if the State did not command the Church) if we did not come to the place of hearing within half an hour after they were in their Pew, (contrary to all duty both to God and man, and what is more, the Antient Cuſtoms of this Town) they would begin Prayers.

Letters to write, which you know may be of great conſequence, or had ſtaid out ſomething late Saturday night, we ſhould loſe ſome, if not all our Devotions.

And the reaſon why we Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſuch cauſe to aſſert the dignity of our Wives, is not only becauſe I married my Maid out of meer love, and ſo affection commands

               <p>Sir, If I could not mortifie, and deny my ſelf, I were unfit to be a Miniſter in this Town. And yet I hope you will pardon me, if, for my further information that I may be the better able to limit and bound mine own Actions) I am a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive into the deportment of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour; I ſuppoſe that when (according to his duty) he did not ſtay beyond the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical hour, when the greater occaſions of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43674:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43674:7"/>
to be obeyed, <hi>non obſtante</hi> Mr. Mayors coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Order; both becauſe they are eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, and the Duty of Obedience to the King and Church perſwades us; and laſtly, becauſe we are ſworn to their ſtrict obſervation.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the King himſelf does not pretend to diſpenſe with Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Court of Chancery (as I have heard) does not judge contrary unto Law, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mitigate, and abate its rigour, or give relief where Common Law gives none; that not the leaſt oppreſſion may be heard in our Streets. And, ſecondly, ſuppoſing the King did diſpenſe with Law, yet Mr. Mayor has only ſo much power as is committed to him in a certain Charter, which indeed gives the Corporation power to make By-Laws, for the benefit of the Town; but by no means liberty, by themſelves, to violate Acts of Parliament, or to permit the breach of them in others: But, as to what we are at preſent making our enquiry into, <hi>viz.</hi> the Laws of the Church, theſe are without the verge of the Corporations Power, and they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther protect us from the Penalties and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments due for ſuch wilful Diſobedience, nor abſolve us from the guilt by the default contracted.</p>

               <p>I thank your Worſhip for your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and condeſcenſion; and ſhall give you to underſtand, that I ought to be obedient to the Church, not only as I am a Member, or a Miniſter, by vertue of which relations I am more eſpecially obliged: But as all Government does ſuppoſe Obedience and Submiſſion due, and we therefore combine in a Common Body, for the preſervation of Propriety, as well as Society; ſo the defect of ſenſe of ſuch an Obligation, violates all the bonds of Authority, breaks down the Pale by which Government and Rule is fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and laies it open to every bold Uſurper, and Intruder. Thus not only Empires and Kingdoms have been laid waſte, and made paſtures only for Birds and Beaſts of Prey; but by this means the Wall, both of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and defenſe, being once aſſaulted, and, in an hoſtile manner, ſcaled and battered,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43674:9"/>
the Temple of God is not only left without its Bulwarks, but invaded and ſhot at by its Adverſaries, until the ſtructure becomes demoliſhed, and there is ſcarce one ſtone left upon another. The Church (you know) is compared to a Vine, fenced in not only by an immediate Providence; but its own Laws, and Authority to enforce them, are not only that which ſupports the branches, but alſo defends the very root: Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw but the Obligation, and ſenſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and all the branches will deſert the root, the Foxes will devour their preſent fruit, and the wild Bore will dig up the root, and thus ſhall the whole languiſh and decay.</p>

miſery, and deſtroying fate of the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, much more when diſobedience dares put off her Mask, and come abroad with open face, hurling all into an Ataxy and Confuſion: when an embodied Society have agreed upon certain Laws and Principles, by which they have both conſtituted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered a part of the whole to take care of the reſt, wherein particular intereſts are alwaies to ſubmit to the preſervation of the general commerce and univerſal welfare; If the actings of particulars ſhall not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear diſorderly and mutinous, but the very <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the foundation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be undermined by a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of any Obedience or Homage due, it muſt needs diſſolve the very Principles, make the Empire crack with its weight and burden, and reduce this Community into an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Chaos.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43674:11"/>
of ſome thing which you already know; I ſhall not trouble you with the ready ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (though uneaſie obedience, by reaſon of thoſe raging and perſecuting thorns from Jewiſh Malice, and Heathen Fury, which continually, like the Souldiers Spear in our Saviours Side, tormented and grieved them) unto the Chriſtian Church, in its Biſhops, and Repreſentatives, in its firſt plantation; though not without the publick aſſaults, of open Hereticks, no more than free from the ſecret thruſts of thoſe that ſeemed boſome Friends. But I know you expect Scripture ſhould be judge, and prove what it ſeems you account a Problem. For the Jews ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Sanhedrim, I hope you will not trouble your ſelf ſo much as to doubt: Nor for the Apoſtles ſubjection to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as to him who had the Government upon his ſhoulders, who received his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Authority from the Father, and was anointed from above. Nor will you queſtion, I ſuppoſe, the ſubmiſſion of the Chriſtian Church to the Diſcipline, as well as Doctrine of the Apoſtles, whom Chriſt inveſted with the ſame Authority that he had received from his Father, in relation to their Preſidency and Juriſdiction over the Church; in that Conſecration of His; <hi>As
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43674:11"/>
my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you:</hi> Only, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, you may ſtill doubt, whether this Rule and Authority requiring ſubmiſſion and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to its Decrees, was conveighed from the Apoſtles to others. But you will have no cauſe to miſtruſt that neither, when you ſhall ſeriouſly reflect upon the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles to the ſeveral Churches; and more eſpecially to thoſe Angels and Biſhops, who were there intruſted with the Diſcipline and Government, as well as feeding the Flock of Chriſt, which he had purchaſed with his bloud. Or if you will obſerve matter of fact, and from thence draw the certainty of our Concluſion; You may read St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſending his Orders to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> giving them directions how to govern the Dioceſſes of <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And it would be endleſs to enumerate all the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Commands to obey our Church Rulers; Obey them (ſaies the Apoſtle) that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give an account.

               <p>I did ſo (Sir) and by Gods help I ſhall perform it; we find there that there was a great difference aroſe at <hi>Antioch</hi> about Circumciſion, for it ſeems there had come down men from <hi>Judea,</hi> who taught the Brethren, that except they were Circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43674:12"/>
be ſaved; They preſently therefore ſelect their Clerks, and depute their Delegates, and Repreſentatives, to go, and joyn with the Colledge at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſo they might have a full Convocation, and their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, thus aſſembled, fully ſilenced all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, and was to them a Rule and Canon, to which they preſently yield obedience.</p>

Secondly, The Council conſiſted principally of the Biſhops of <hi>Judea;</hi> whereof one, to wit, <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was Preſident. Finally, Upon ſtrict view of the whole, we find that probably there were but four Apoſtles there, to wit, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who were there before, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſent from <hi>Antioch.</hi> And this, craving your Worſhips pardon, I muſt look upon for my Rule.</p>

Alas, this making Religion ſuch a cloſs Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſes it to become like Steel bodies, that ſometimes reduce the extravagancy of a ſhoulderblade, but breed an Ulcer and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in the Lungs.

Theſe Caſes of Conſcience have ſpoyled the World: If you purſue the Conſequence of your Diſcourſe, I think you will quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us all, and then we ſhall not have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our Clergy.</hi>

Thoſe Oaths and Vows then, which I ſuppoſe you are not obliged to keep, are theſe three: The Solemn League and Covenant, the Negative Oath, and the Engagement; as too many that may be more private, let them ſtill remain, as they had their firſt Sanction private betwixt God and your own Conſcience.</p>

and under every hedge an Ambuſcado; but ſhall endeavour to rout the main body, and then the ſmaller Parties will ſeparate of themſelves. The Covenant then is not only to be renounced, but abhorred by all the peaceable Profeſſors of Chriſtianity. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is quite oppoſite to our natural Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to our King, by vertue of which we are obliged, to preſerve his Royal Perſon, againſt, not only Private Inſurrections at home, but, Publick Enemies abroad; and not to make our ſelves Judges of his Actions ſo far, as, with limitation and condition, only to defend and preſerve his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Authority, ſo far as his ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and defend the true Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdoms, as in the third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Solemn League: For if this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude be given to the Subjects of any Prince, his Religion and Actions muſt of neceſſity be arraigned at the private Bars of thoſe Subjects, that are moſt inferiour, as well as thoſe that attend more immediately upon the Throne; and every particular muſt plead a lawful and ſufficient excuſe for withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the preſervation of his Prince, if he ſhall, either through Ignorance, or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, conjecture, that the King does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the true Religion, or the Laws and

Liberties of the Kingdom; which what they are, is ſti11 left to the raſhneſs, or indiſcretion of every ignorant and illiterate head.

               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you, Sir, for your recalling of a wandring thought. The ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have learned againſt the Covenant, is, That it is contrary to the Prerogative of Kings, not only appropriate to them under the Old Teſtament, but alſo, as ſoon as they became Chriſtian, under the New; that is, to have the power of reforming Religion in their own hands; and this was ſufficiently expreſſed in the Oath of Supremacy (which I queſtion not but that you had before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) where the King's Majeſty is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and under the moſt Sacred Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion owned, the Supreme Ruler and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Kingdom, governing all Perſons and Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and Civil: And not only ſo, but you added an Oath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and make your promiſe Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, to defend and preſerve, as much as in you lay, his Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Praeeminencies, and Authorities whatſoever, either granted and commended to the truſt and managery of the Kings Majeſty, or elſe joyned and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Kingdom. Part of which, there is none that underſtands any thing of the State of his Country, or Religion, but immediately
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43674:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reckons Spiritual, or Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for correction and amendment of all Errors, and abuſes in Church Affairs. To enter therefore into a League and Covenant, contradicting and violating a former Oath, that plucked alſo a choice Jewel out of our Sovereigns Crown, and entrenched upon his Royal Prerogative, is an Action to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by Mankind, and damned to that place, to which, it is to be feared, it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned many a Promoter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe methinks are hard words, and were it not a derogation to my Honour, and a blemiſh upon my Grandeur, I could almoſt be ſorry, and ſigh for my taking it; But I hope, as I was ſaying but now, I ſhall paſs ſtill among the Herd.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, without repentance, it muſt be amongſt the Goats then; and I would adviſe you (and if in any thing I may inform, then in this) to be ſerious, where Eternity will be the meaſure either of your bliſs or miſery: Will you be pleaſed that I ſhall proceed to the third reaſon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, to any thing, ſo as I may be rid of thoſe I have already heard.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Then, thirdly, your Worſhip muſt eaſily grant, that it was not impoſed by a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43674:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſufficient power. For an Oath cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be taken by a perſon ſubject to another, in relation to thoſe particulars in which his ſubjection is due, or to conſtitute any thing, or confirm it, by ſuch a Solemn Sanction, concerning thoſe matters in which he is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubjected, without the leave and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his Superiour. Firſt, Becauſe in this he does an injury to another, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges himſelf to injuſtice by an Oath; becauſe he determines, and diſpoſes of thoſe matters, and affairs, that are totally dependent upon anothers Commands. And, Secondly, becauſe every one, in thoſe things in which he is ſubjected to a Superiour, is bound to attend and obey his Will, and be paſſive only in relation unto his diſpoſal, to whom he has been obliged, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Nature, Contract, or a precedent Oath; which no ſubſequent can diſanul. And though theſe Reaſons are ponderous enough to weigh down whatever can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the contrary; yet, if you try them by the weights of the Sanctuary, you will not find a grain deficient. For the thirtieth of <hi>Numbers</hi> is, throughout the whole, a compleat confirmation of this particular; where if a woman, remaining in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe, whileſt ſhe is under his tuition
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43674:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Government, vow a Vow unto God, and bind her ſelf by a moſt Sacred Bond; that Bond and Vow, though never ſo ſolemn, was to be null, and void, if her Father diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it.</p>

               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Holy League (I hope) was no ſuch thing, that was cloathed with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie Circumſtances.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, that it was; For, firſt, the King not only diſallowed, but proteſted againſt it, ſo far was he from giving it the leaſt Contenance, or Sanction: And had he indeed conſented to that, he knew he ſhould ſeale his own ruine, as well as violate his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath, and make a Deed of Gift of all his Prerogative.</p>

               <p>It was a Net, Sir, that was fit to fiſh with in troubled waters, for had not the Rivers been ſtained with bloud, and the Clouds of Heaven, as well as the Mud of the Earth, darkned the Waters, it is impoſſible that ſo much fiſh ſhould have come to net; the Web being ſo monſtrouſly big, that all that had eyes would have ſeen the Snare: but ſo it was, that it had fatal Circumſtances attending it, that it might prove a ruine to

The matter of the Covenant was not within your own power, becauſe thoſe very things which you Covenanted to alter and extirpate, and what you ſwore to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43674:29"/>
defend and maintain, were all contrary to that duty and ſubjection which before, both by Birth, and Oaths, you owed to his Majeſty.</p>

the Covenant) than there has been of this Scotch Monſter; however, that we may ſee alſo how great friends they are to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, we need travel no further than the third Article, which engages us to preſerve the Kings Perſon, only in the conſervation of true Religion, and the Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which laies him open (as I hinted before) to every Traytor or Enthuſiaſt, that has, either malice, or, madneſs enough to conclude him an enemy to both, or either: But (what may be worth your obſervation) in the ſame Article, in which the preſervation of the King's naked Perſon, ſtripped of all his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is limited, care is taken, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament, and the Liberty of the People be ſtrictly maintained, without an interpretation or reſtriction at all; which loudly proclaimes to the whole World what friendſhip this League deſigned for his Majeſty.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43674:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Act with your Judgment, which the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Law then only ſeemed to extort; to wit, the renunciation of the Covenant: Yet I ſhall further, I hope, enhance your abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of this ſtrange Beaſt, no leſs than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your laſt conſequence and deduction; when I ſhall remember you, that the next Article (beſides that it aſſumes a moſt Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, Tyrannical, and Arbitrary Power, in bringing men to what we know not who ſhall deem condign puniſhment) does countenance and encourage (and not only ſo, but bind men by the Solemnity of an Oath) to Parricide, Regicide, and any the greateſt Villanies in the World. How eaſie was it by vertue of that for Husbands to eaſe themſelves of unpleaſant Wives, or Wives to divorce themſelves from thoſe Husbands that they found their affections, either out of wantonneſs, or curioſity, to decline from? How eaſie a way was this for the Son to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into his Fathers years, before nature gave period to his life; that ſo he might be the preſent Poſſeſſour of what he was only heir to before? Nay, for the Subjects to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and condemn their Prince (ſince it was without reſpect of perſons) could they but once affix the Title of Incendiary, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or obſtructer of the Reformed Religion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43674:31"/>
upon him? The definition of each particular of which was left in their own breaſts to inſpire.</p>

               <p>I thank you, Sir, for that Metaphor; for nothing but that could ſo well have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded me of the Covenant: We have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43674:32"/>
already diſpatched half the Articles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned one more to make them even; and the fifth is nothing but talking of Peace in the midſt of War, and boaſting of ſtrange effects of reconcilement, when all know there was no ſuch thing, and therefore here the failing of the Saints was ſuperadded to the Perjury of the Sinner. And finally, as to the Sixth Article, it only ſuppoſes, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, what we have already refuted in particular; that the cauſe of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was the defence of Religion, together with the Liberty and Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that the whole tended to the glory of God, the Publick Advantage, and the Kings Honour; and therefore the Jurors here ſwore to remain conſtant in the purſuit of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt all oppoſition throughout the whole courſe of their lives: Thus did it not only enſnare a Nation with good words, to dig out their own Bowels, to rage againſt Nature it ſelf, and ſheath their Swords in their neareſt Relations, to pull down and ruine the moſt glorious Church in the whole World, and force it to be truly Militant; but (what may ſupperadd the Complement to all its deformed daſhes) it made the King a Slave to his Subjects, diveſted him of all his Royal Robes, and made him ſacrifice his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43674:32"/>
Head to preſerve his Crown, which it would alſo have deprived him of, but that his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom eternized it.</p>

               <p>No, Sir, I ſhould be ſtrangely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil if I ſhould draw ſuch Concluſions, for in that your Worſhip would be concerned; but this I ſhall be bold to ſay, That the threefold Cord tied him to the Block, and left him there for another Party to cut off his head. But I expected your Worſhip ſhould, after all this digreſſion, have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to diſcover the ſtrengeh of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by reducing the whole to ſome ſhort Form.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truly, that being uſually Mr. Mayors work when we, by chance, debate of any thing, I think the length of our diſcourſe had made me almoſt forget where I was, and ſo expected that ſhould be the work of another; content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf with a ſerious reflection upon what you have already ſaid; but now my memory is a little awaked, I muſt call upon you to diſcover to me the force of this third Argument.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>If it ſhall pleaſe your Worſhip it is briefly this. That Oath which was not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43674:33"/>
impoſed by a ſufficient power, was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But the Covenant was not impoſed by a ſufficient power, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how has that laſt Clauſe been proved?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>That has been thus evinced, becauſe the King had no ſhare in the impoſition, but proteſted againſt it: And we, being his Subjects, cannot enter into a League with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, ſo much eſpecially to the prejudice and detriment of his Prerogative, and our own Priviledges as this is, and by a diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant it has particularly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; I ſhall add this too, as a final Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this third Argument; that this Oath was not impoſed by that which the very Impoſers declared to be ſufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; nay, not by that which was pretended moſt for its enforcement, to wit, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Authority: For then it ſhould have been by a Statute, but this could not poſſibly be obtained when neither the King, nor Biſhops, nor many other of both Houſes, would at all be preſent, or conſent to it; and ſo it becomes notoriouſly repugnant to the Petition of Right, no leſs than to an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Proteſtation, beſides the Obligations before mentioned; ſufficient to vacat what a great many have thought an Obligation, ſince
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43674:33"/>
this Covenant obliges to nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

                  <hi>Well, Sir, that you may haſten to a new Theam (for I am ſufficiently informed of the unlawfulneſs of this Oath, and therefore ſhall not only beg forgiveneſs and pardon from Almighty God, but endeavour to avoid ſuch ſnares for the time to come) Have you any thing more that you would add upon this head?</hi>

               <p>I am glad to hear your Worſhip of ſuch a pious and Chriſtian temper, to yield to a Conviction, and not be aſhamed to confeſs guilt, and beg pardon, where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience diſcovers an offence. I ſhall add no more therefore to enforce your Conviction, but only mind you of one thing, which you may, your ſelf, at your next peruſal obſerve in the Covenant, and that is, the Amphibologies, and Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that it is clear to me, that it was at firſt Sathans work; it is ſo like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of the Delphick Oracle, which were alwaies capable of a double interpretation, that ſo, if any thing ſhould happen to the detriment of one, they might have another ready to preſerve its reputation.</p>

                  <hi>Though I was alwaies tender of the Reputation of the Corporation, of which I have the honour to be not one of the leaſt Members;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43674:34"/>
and therefore according to my duty withſtand any thing that may be derogatory to our Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur: Yet God forbid, that I ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to eſtabliſh Iniquity either by Authority, or Law; and ſo far ſhut mine eyes againſt the light of the Sun, as not to acknowledge thoſe beams of Conviction that are at any time darted into my Conſcience: I am heartily ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that either the love of Faction, and change of that Religion which I now perceive to be ancient and good, or the covetous preſervation of my Eſtate, have formerly prevailed ſo far with me as to cauſe me to eſpouſe ſuch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel as was neither advantageous to the Publick, or ſafe for mine own Conſcience; and that the ſame Principles ſhould ever be ſo prevalent, as to cauſe me thus, not only to take an unlawful Oath, but, to ſeal my Obligation to the League and Covenant with manifeſt Perjury, and breach of all my former Oaths; but I hope I ſhall, by my future Loyalty, teſtifie my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance both to God, and man; and by a double diligence redeem that faithfulneſs and reputation which by my raſh Acts I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly forfeited.

great Dagon, which is now fallen, but that I had (as I have great reaſon both from mine own Office and your Kindneſs) a cordial reſpect to your future welfare, that you might have true Peace of Conſcience here, and everlaſting bliſs in the World to come.</p>

I like your diſcourſe ſo well, that I muſt beg the favour from you to go on to the diſcovery of thoſe blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes that are viſible in thoſe other entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to wit, she Negative Oath, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43674:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with all chearfulneſs and reſolution under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it: but becauſe their Villany does not lye covered with briars and thorns, as this of the Covenant did; but as Rebellion gained ſtrength, and had Victory and Succeſs to encourage and embolden it, ſo it came abroad and diſcovered it ſelf to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous multitude, without Mask or Vail; and ſo exhibited its gaſtly countenance to be exactly delineated and proportioned, by thoſe that did not take <hi>Hecuba</hi> for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and ſo far retained their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to refuſe to be in love with defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>

               <p>Your Worſhip need not fear my Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility in this reſpect, our diſcourſe upon theſe will be brief enough, ſince to a blind man they will almoſt appear at firſt rehearſal totally to ſubvert and deſtroy Monarchy, taking it away both Root and Branch. Firſt, as to the Negative Oath, wherein you ſwore neither directly nor indirectly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43674:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to, or aſſiſt, in that preſent War, either his Majeſty, or any other Forces, raiſed by any Power whatſoever without the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of both Houſes of Parliament; and that you would wholly be within the power and diſpoſal of the Parliament. What did this but plainly contradict both your Oath of Allegeance, and natural duty that you owed unto the King? And therefore you cannot but deem your ſelves Traitors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to his Majeſty, as far as you abetted, or aſſiſted any againſt him. And if we ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradd the Engagement to this Negative Oath, we ſhall eaſily ſee how Villany and Regicide crept on by degrees, untill it had arrived at that height from whence it might command, and enſlave a Nation. You firſt covenanted to lay open his Majeſty to every bold and bloudy Traitor, whileſt you would preſerve and defend him no longer, than you had a mind to think him a Defender of the Faith, and, what you ſhould think, the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Kingdom. Thus did you exalt your ſelves above your Prince, and make him a Slave to your wills, expoſing him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that by a Combination, to all the hazards and cruelty, of malice or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Then leaſt his Crown and Life ſhould
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43674:36"/>
be too ſafe in ſuch generals, and all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould not be alike viſited with the ſame Vertigo, but might have their ſouls at liberty from Enthuſiaſm, and Zeal boyled to rage and madneſs; and, conſequently, might judge his Majeſty both a Defender of the true faith, and a conſtant Maintainer of the Subjects Priviledge, as well as his own Prerogative; It was thought good, by thoſe godly Deſigners of his ſlaughter and butchery, to oblige the People to a cloſer invaſion of his Life and Fortunes, by denying him the aſſiſtance of their own; that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left naked to himſelf, his Adverſaries might eaſily bring him to their Demands, that at laſt they might offer his Crown and Revenues to their Covetouſneſs and Luſt; and ſacrifice his Bloud to thoſe infernal Gods, that had vouchſafed their aſſiſtance in ſo glorious a Reformation. And finally, when this witneſſing time was come, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from the noiſe of Drum and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet they might ſerve themſelves in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; That there might no opportunity remain for the dead Ghoſt to terrifie and affrighten, or the living Poſterity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or regain their own; you were all engaged to be true and faithful to the Government that was then eſtabliſhed

               <p>The beſt uſe that your Worſhip can make of it now, is (next to your repentance, and reſolution of Loyalty) to ſee what an inextricable Labyrinth of Vice and Miſery we ſlip into, for want of due conſideration: Raſhneſs and inadvertency, as they damn many an immortal Soul, ſo do they waſte and conſume our Eſtates and Welfare in this World. But that no intermediate diſcourſe may give an interruption to our preſent Scrutiny, and obſtruct the diſcovery of the horrid Impiety and moſt ſcandalous Perjury of thoſe who took theſe Oaths; I muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inform you that in theſe Oaths, firſt, the Oaths both of Allegeance and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were moſt blaſpemouſly violated, by an Obligation (for ſo I call theſe improperly) that quite contradicted and deſtroyed their very intent, and the deſign for which they were firſt invented. Secondly, By theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oaths; even the Covenant it ſelf in the third Article (which was accounted ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Solemn, and, even to this day, is made an holy Cheat, and religious Garment,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43674:37"/>
to hide Treachery and Rebellion under) is ſo notoriouſly and publikely violated, and broken, that I cannot but wonder, that any man who has taken the Engagement, ſhould have the confidence to aſſert his duty to keep the Covenant Sacred. Thirdly, They are oppoſite to the Liberty of the Subject, in that they were impoſed without a Law. And (laſtly) they were the moſt bloudy and ſcandalous reproach that ever was to the Proteſtant Religion; to reform our ſelves by Sacriledge and Perjury, to blaſpheme God for his honour and glory, to enſlave a Prince to his Subjects Luſt, and cut off his head to make him glorious, to pull down Altars that we might offer Sacrifice, and demoliſh Temples, to ſay our Prayers; And finally, to root out, and for ever extirpate what Nature, and Piety, beſides Philoſophy and long Experience, had convinced us to be the beſt Government in the World.</p>

                  <hi>Truly, Sir, I have not commonly uſed my ſelf unto too many Scruples, my Trade en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging me to heavier weights: nor had a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man need have his Conſcience very ſtrait and full, that does not intend to have his purſe empty.</hi>

               <p>Though your Worſhips Trade be more large and great, than to be very ſtrict in Weights and Meaſures; and I know that Conſcience, and its Owners Purſe are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not only more alike than you ſeem to make them, but, in ſome things the very ſame, and as much kin, as <hi>Hippocrates's</hi> Twins, not only partake of each others Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but open and ſhut both together; and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43674:38"/>
all the Difference is only this, that here the Purſe is the Elder Brother, to whom the other ſerves and obeys: Yet Juſtice to your ſelf is exact to a Scruple.</p>

however of the taking of thoſe Oaths; I queſtion not, but that you will, within a few minutes, as cordially, and as readily conclude, that there is no Obligation can reſt upon you, or any other of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects, to obſerve all, or part of either, by vertue of any of thoſe impoſitions.</p>

                  <hi>Truly, Sir, you never found me an enemy unto Reaſon, though I know, in theſe things of divine concernment, it has been looked upon as carnal.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Reaſon was ſo carnal, that ſpiritual men made as much uſe of it as their parts and Enthuſiaſm would permit; only, becauſe for moſt of their attempts and actions, they had little or no reaſon at all; we cannot well blame them for decrying that, which they ſaw became ſo great an obſtructor of their procedure: However I ſhall adventure to give you ſome Argument, why a former Oath, legally taken, whoſe matter was alſo juſt and lawful, muſt of neceſſity vacat the Obligation of any that ſhall, through Impiety, or Surreption, be future, and ſucceed, which bears any oppoſition to the former.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pray do that, Sir, and then the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the matter in hand will not be difficult.</hi>

               <p>Really, Sir, this debt is ſo eaſily acquitted, that your Worſhip ſhall demand it no more: For the Caſe is plain at the firſt propoſal, and needs no more than its own Explication. If the former Oath be in all things lawful, and fails neither in matter nor Circumſtances; whatever is admitted oppoſite to this is <hi>eo nomine</hi> unlawful, and conſequently has no force or Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Though I have no great reaſon to complain of my want of underſtanding, yet really, Sir, I do not perfectly apprehend your Argument.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>That ſeems to me to be very ſtrange, and yet I have no more reaſon to be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that you apprehend not my way of arguing, than I have to diſturbe my ſelf for that many times I underſtand not your way of Juſtice. But that I may leave no obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in my Phraſe, I muſt ſtill inſiſt that a ſubſequent Oath contradicting a former, which was lawfully impoſed, and good, both in matter and circumſtances, muſt either be unlawful, or elſe the two terms of a contradiction may be both true; and ſo, lawful and unlawful become reconciled; or if this be ſtill to you a demonſtration of <hi>ignotum per ignotius,</hi> I can otherwiſe enforce the Propoſition.</p>

                  <hi>But before you do that, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you of one thing that I am ſure is omitted, that muſt a little limit your aſſertion, which ſeems to me to be too general.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, what is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is moſt certain, that an Oath may be taken that is contrary to a former, and yet be Obligatory; As for Example: There was an Act (you know) made againſt the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, whoſe power was to expire at three years end; now all thoſe that by their Oaths or Office were obliged to execute that Law, if at the three years end a Law ſhould have been made oppoſite to the former, they might lawfully ſwear to the execution of this oppoſite Law, and this latter Oath would oblige.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Your Worſhips diſcourſe is now fallacious (and I hope you will pardon the Expreſſion becauſe it is a term of Art) were the Laws both running together, and the former not limited by a time, that took off the Obligation of the former Oath, the latter Oath would have been ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing that end, that it muſt therefore have been unlawful, becauſe repugnant to the former Obligation: but now the former Obligation being ceaſed, becauſe the matter of it was already vacated, and the Bond was but for a certain time; and the ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43674:40"/>
Power, that by Enacting the Law, brought it within the limits of the Executors Oath, did now void it by the expiration of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and conſequently vacated ſo much of the general Oath as related to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, Sir, I apprehend the reſolution of this doubt: but as to your general Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that a latter Oath cannot make void the Obligation to a former, if the former were lawful, and has the reaſon of its Bond ſtill remaining; I cannot yet apprehend your proof, but muſt expect ſome Argument that may evince it to mine own capacity.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>I heartily thank your Worſhip that you will not permit any promiſe of mine to remain unpaid, and I hope I ſhall have the ſame Act of Juſtice performed to me. The reaſon to be added then was this; Becauſe a latter Oath, oppoſite and repugnant to a former, binds me to what is <hi>de jure</hi> impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For having obliged my ſelf by my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Bond, that muſt in equity be diſcharged; now to bind my ſelf, by a ſubſequent Oath, to what is deſtructive of this former Bond, obſtructs and hinders, nay (ſhould it be obligatory) for ever prohibits the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my precedent promiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently brings upon me the guilt of Perjury,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43674:40"/>
for not diſcharging my antecedent Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus, Sir, the taking an Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a former, is the ſame with thoſe that enter into Oaths for the performance of thoſe things, in reſpect of which they are ſubject to another, and ſo are not within their own power; which all reaſon at firſt Audit will proclaim and publiſh both null and void.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>In my Judgment, you have in this, an unfortunate way of explaining your ſelf; or elſe long audience and diſcourſe have dulled my judgment and apprehenſion: Methinks hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have underſtood you well, but in this you ſeem too obſcure.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>I have more charity, and confidence in your Worſhip, than to conjecture that you ſhelter ſomething of ſtrange deſign under the pretenſe of ignorance and defect of ſatisfaction; will you be pleaſed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your patience in a little more attention to this thing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall hearken to you very chearfully, and (as much as my buſineſs will permit me) without diſtraction.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Then, Sir, be pleaſed to obſerve, that a former Oath (therefore Obligatory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Legal) does bind a perſon ſo much to a diſcharge, that 'till he has performed, he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43674:41"/>
is not within his own power; but has deprived himſelf of his own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, either to diſcharge his promiſe, or not to diſcharge it, by vertue of that Oath and Obligation; and therefore can neither in Juſtice, nor Reaſon enter into a contrary Bond.</p>

               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>You are ſometime, Mr. Vicar, good at a compariſon; cannot you make me apprehenſive of your meaning by a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, that I can: Suppoſe I owed to your Worſhip an hundred pounds, which I promiſed you to pay at ſuch a time; and, after this, I engaged to another not to pay you your money; which of theſe promiſes do you think I were obliged to perform?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>The former, without doubt, to pay me my money.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>And do you think the latter promiſe could at all diſoblige me from my former to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>No, by no means, for then any man may lawfully play the knave.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Apply this then to the Caſe in hand, and you will find that, in a Promiſſory Oath, there is not only the Obligation of a promiſe, but it becomes a ſolemn as the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43674:41"/>
ſtrongeſt Engagement can make it. For you not only call God to witneſs the preſent Contract, and conſequently to teſtifie againſt both your injuſtice and unfaithfulneſs, if you do not perform it; but by your own mouth you curſe your ſelf, and pray God to obſerve, both your promiſe,, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and puniſh you ſeverely, if you do not faithfully diſcharge this Obligation. This is included in the laſt Clauſe annexed to your promiſe; So help you God by the contents of the Book, which you then kiſs to ſeal the truth both of the one and of the other. Now then, if your bare promiſe, in the former caſe, where your intereſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, was concluded by you, not only ſufficient to oblige to its faithful performance, but alſo, to ſuperſede all future engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that did attempt to null the former Obligation; much more muſt it be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, and convincing, when, to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, there is ſuperadded an Oath; in which not only your own Concerns, both in relation to your Eſtate and Liberty, as a Subject of <hi>England;</hi> and in relation to your Soul as liable to an account before a future Tribunal; but alſo the King and Kingdoms welfare, in relation to the intereſt of Church and State, are wrapp'd up. Much more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43674:42"/>
(I ſay) muſt this oblige to a full and faithful performance and diſcharge, and be a bar againſt either the lawfulneſs, or obligation of any future Oath to the contrary.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Your Argument muſt of neceſſity now be convincing, and I muſt be unfaithful to mine own faculties, and not only ſo, but (what we account a great deal worſe) reject mine own intereſt and concerns, ſhould I again have my belief ſo impoſed upon, as to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that an Oath, or Promiſe, is vacated, by any thing of either kind to the contrary, that may be ſubſequent to what went before; and therefore I now ſee that the Covenant and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement (thoſe accurſed impoſitions, and deſtructive gins to enſnare ſouls) oblige to nothing but repentance; and I muſt ſeriouſly put my mind upon an undiſſembled godly ſorrow, for that I was ſo raſh and unadviſed, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch guilt and blemiſhes upon my ſoul by ſuch manifeſt Villanies, and horrid Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and God grant, that my Repentance may be as true, as my Conviction powerful.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, Sir, that I have; for they are (according to my management) as good money as any Commodity I have in my Shop: I had three of them, 'till one of them ran away from me, and, in another place, bound himſelf Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to another Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>And do not your Worſhip look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as your Servant, and obliged to ſerve out his time ſtill?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes: and I can, in Conſcience, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well a in Juſtice, and Law, force him to come hither again.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>But, it ſeems, he has ſince contracted with another.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>But will not his laſt Contract

null and vacat his former relation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>No: For if it would, we ſhall not dare truſt our Apprentices out of our Shops; Nor give them any correction when they deſerve it; nor make that gain upon them which we uſually do, by a thrifty way we have of dealing with them, but immediately they would deſert our ſervice, and oblige themſelves by Contract to another.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are Inconveniences bad enough, eſpecially to you, who (it ſeems) drive a Trade in Apprentices; but there muſt be ſome formal reaſon, why your Servants Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with another does not vacat his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contract with you.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Methinks your own reaſon might dictate an Argument ſufficient to you.</hi>

               <p>You know, Sir, that I have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent all this while, and now I would fain become the Catechiſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I will not quarrel at that word; for your continual teſtimony of your civility and ſubmiſſion, give an uncontroulable evidence, that you do not think you have boyes to deal with.</hi>

               <p>I wiſh we had only thoſe to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe; for then there would be hope that the Nation would be well Principled in time; it gives me ſome cauſe of miſtruſt, that you
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43674:44"/>
think I have a deſign in theſe queſtions; but I would only know your reaſon, Why the Contract of your Apprentice with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot make void his Praecontract with you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is plain, and obvious to any; and I wonder you will be ſo ſcrupulous to ask.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, becauſe I would be informed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the reaſon is, becauſe he was my Servant before; and ſo cannot become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to another, 'till his time is firſt expired with me.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Then (if I apprehend you) your reaſon is this; Your Apprentice, being before bound to you, was not at his own liberty, to indent with any other, 'till, firſt, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his Obligation to you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter Contract muſt needs be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an undutiful attempt, and becomes void in the very Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have now well expreſſed my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is not this reaſon argumentative?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Truly I think it ſo concluſive, that it will not admit of any anſwer.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Then you have now done my work for me, and I hope you will not by any means diſlike your own actions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your meaning, Sir.</hi>

               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Did not you ask me, but now, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he that was not in his own power, by reaſon of the Obligation a former Oath, could not lawfully take a ſubſequent oppoſite to the former, and if taken, could not oblige?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I did, but what then?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Then apply but the Caſe your App<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, to the matter in hand, and then, what you deemed a Problem, is manifeſt to you, according to your deſire, by a familiar Similitude.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed (Mr. Vicar) herein you have been too hard for me, and caught me in a Net of mine own making.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, Sir, however it is ſutable to your Trade, for you to deliver out the twine, when 'tis another makes the net.</p>

               <p>Indeed, Sir, I am not at all ſorry nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I had both ſuch matter, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to enforce it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ald.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I think now you have ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all my doubts, and given me abundant ſatisfaction, that what I before renounced out of Intereſt and Formality, I ſhall now do out

of Conſcience and Duty. But now I think of it, there is one potent Objection, that a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Miniſter (who indeed I think is a good man) urged againſt me the other day, when he would have drawn me over to his Party.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, what is that? And I am the more earneſt to know, becauſe men of that Character, by which you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that Gentleman you mentioned without a name, have as little reaſon for moſt they fay, as any Party that I know.</p>

                  <hi>I know not what reaſon you ſuppoſe them Maſters of; but this Argument was like to ſtartle me, (and I am not well ſatisfied about it yet) it was the example of the</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites.</p>

Was it becauſe their Garments were old, and ſo might be Objects fit for your Charity? Or becauſe they came out of a far Country, and ſo might be good Merchandize here?</p>

               <p>It is not becauſe I fear any difficulty, more than ordinary, in that example you ſeem ſo much to triumph in; but becauſe I think there is a great parallel betwixt the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi> that cheated <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a League, and thoſe Non-conformiſts, you ſeemed to applaud, who religiouſly betrayed others into a Covenant: But becauſe I would not at any time baulk a Fanaticks Argument, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you know, modeſt men, I will not only tell you the place, but find it out ready to your hands.</p>

                  <hi>It is in brief this.

Now this Oath muſt of neceſſity be unlawful, becauſe contrary to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of the total extirpation of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And yet the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>think themſelves obliged to keep this Oath, notwithſtanding the illegality of it,</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>Nay, to confirm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradiction, the Obligation of the Oath, not only from the reaſon of the Princes of the Congregation; we have ſworn to them by the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>now therefore we may not touch them; but becauſe, ſomewhere I am ſure in</hi> David's <hi>time, we find Almighty God viſiting the Land with three years Famine;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43674:48"/>
and the reaſon of the judgment is particularly expreſſed; becauſe, contrary to their Oath,</hi> Saul <hi>ſlew the</hi> Gibeonites.</p>

               <p>I cannot well fail in this, where the condition is ſo manifeſt, and apparent; You know, in all Statutes, the Preface contains the reaſon of Enacting; and therefore an Act of Parliament is uſually interpreted by the Preamble; and the deſign and intent of any Law is to be diſcovered from the cauſe and reaſon of its Sanction: Thus is it in the caſe in hand; God prohibites a League with theſe Nations, leſt it ſhould prove a ſnare to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

               <p>No, Sir, for if you pleaſe to look farther into the Text; at the 14 and 15 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, you ſhall find, that the reaſon why a League, with any of the Inhabitants, might prove a ſnare to <hi>Iſrael</hi> was; becauſe, by their example, and familiarity, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might be drawn to the Commiſſion of Idolatry: Which is alſo the ſame reaſon again repeated in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4. when the cauſe of this fear then ceaſeth, the Prohibition is vacated, where the reaſon of the Law is totally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.</p>

And ſhould not the Law have been thus attended with condition, there would have been no room left for Repentance, and conſequently the Almighty would have offered violence to his own Mercy, which he has declared to be over all has works, and is an Attribute in which he moſt delights.</p>

                  <hi>Well, Sir; that you may not think me alwaies wedded to mine own opinion, but that I may by the power of Argument and Reaſon be ſometimes divorced from my belief; I muſt of neceſſity confeſs your inſtances have convinced me, that this great Prohibition was Conditional, and, conſequently, not ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>To anſwer this, I muſt diſtinguiſh of a double League; there is a Social League,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43674:51"/>
ſuch as one Prince makes with another upon honourable, and ſometimes advantageous terms to both; and this was ſimply forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: but there is a League with a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Enemy (as upon the yielding a Town to the Beſiegers, or a whole Nation becoming Tributary to a Conquerour) and ſuch a one might be ſtruck with thoſe, that, relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing their Idolatry, were in the nature of Proſelytes; and ſubmitting themſelves, would pay Tribute to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> which I take at firſt to be the caſe of the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But, if you have rightly ſtated the difference betwixt the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, methinks, 'tis ſomewhat ſtrange, that</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua <hi>ſeemed ſo much concerned for his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; and that the whole Congregation ſhould ſo ſeverely murmur againſt their Princes, for ſwearing to theſe</hi> Gibeonites.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>All this may very well be reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with our precedent diſcourſe; for the Princes having made this League, and bound it by an Oath, and not, according to their duty, enquired of God, they might fear a Judgment for than omiſſion, and this might be the cauſe of their diſcontent and murmuring.</p>

But to leave ſuch diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know, at preſent, they may be bold, having almoſt the ſame priviledge with your ſelves. Since this Non-conformiſt has given you this trouble, by his Objection: I would have you endeavour to requite him, by exhibiting an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43674:53"/>
example that may convince the truth of your former Poſition, that an unlawful Oath is not Obligatory, and binds to nothing but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; by this means you ſhall diſcharge your debt to him, by putting him to the expenſe of an anſwer, or, for defect of that, to be liable to the diſparagement of a baffle in his own Trade: As alſo you will, by this, carry on your main deſign of confirming and ſtrengthening that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which you have been a means to raiſe in me.</hi>

An example now preſents it ſelf to my mind, (ſo great a deſign and prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is there even in my very memory to ſerve you) that will plainly evidence that an unlawful Oath binds to nothing but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

               <p>Very good. Thus then the proof is attempted. <hi>David</hi> being provoked by the churliſhneſs of <hi>Nabal,</hi> to whom he had ſent Meſſengers for Proviſion, made a Vow, with an Execration to himſelf, to kill all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to <hi>Nabal,</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>For ſo,</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>and more alſo, do God unto the Enemies of</hi> David, <hi>if I leave, of all that pertain to him, by the morning light, any that piſſeth againſt the wall.</hi> That is, let God thus permit the Enemies of <hi>David</hi> to triumph and affront him unpuniſhed, if I ſuffer any of <hi>Nabals</hi> Family to live 'till the morning. Here you ſee <hi>David</hi> had obliged himſelf by what moſt would conjecture a ſufficient Bond: And yet, when <hi>Abigail</hi> comes, and in the behalf of her Husband, falls at his feet, begs his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and gives him her Preſent: <hi>David</hi> was ſo far from purſuing his raſh and bloudy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that he acknowledgeth guilt in his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate inadvertency, and gives praiſe and glory to Almighty God, who had raiſed up <hi>Abigail,</hi> not only to meet him, but to obviate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43674:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his deſign alſo, and to divert his intention from ſhedding bloud: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael</hi> (ſaies he, Ver. 32.) <hi>which ſent thee this day to meet me, and bleſſed be thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me, this day, from coming to ſhed bloud, and from avenging my ſelf with mine own hand.</hi> And that he totally deſiſted from the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Oath and Vow (which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declared wicked, in that it obliged him to a murder, to gratifie his Revenge) is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently manifeſt, from his diſmiſſion of <hi>Abigail,</hi> Ver. 35. <hi>Go up in peace to thine houſe, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accepted thy perſon.</hi> So that from this Example it plainly appears, that an unlawful Vow or Oath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges to nothing but ſorrow and repentance for ones raſhneſs and inadvertency.</p>

door had no greater Mark, or Badge of Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, than the biggeſt heap of Oyſter ſhells; or that when Qeen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to Town, and Mr. Mayor and the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion met her on horſeback, and riding through the River, his Worſhips Horſe would have been ſo bold, as to drink in the ſame Cup with the Queens; which he being a well-bred Gentleman, repreſſed, the reaſon being asked, he told the Queen in very good Language, that he ſhould not be ſo unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly to drink, 'till her Majeſtie's had done. Had I revived ſuch Stories as theſe, your Worſhip indeed might have juſtly blamed me for reviling the Corporation, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you and your horſes together; but ſince I inſtanced only in a few Cuſtoms, not much taken notice of abroad in the World, and that, privately, betwixt you, and I, for an entrance only to the ſerious ſtate of a uſeful Problem; I hope I ſhall obtain your forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and pardon (ſince even that is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary to your good nature) for what I have ſaid; and then, I ſhall immediately exhibite my preſent thoughts, and reading, concerning the Obligation of your Cuſtoms in general by vertue of your Oath, without refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon any particulars.</p>

As you are a Subject of the Realm, you are no doubt obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and keep, as much as in you lies, all the Rights, which by Law, or Cuſtom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be juſt, and lawful; and yet you are not bound to obſerve thoſe things, that, even amongſt the Learned in the Law, are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, that they become ſo doubtful, as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43674:59"/>
to be rendred altogether uncertain, and 'tis not yet determined in which part duty and obedience is expected. Yet a Subject ought alwaies to have his will ſo ready for Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as ſoon as theſe doubts ſhall be taken away, to ſubject himſelf according as Law ſhall direct his Duty, and a full determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion regulate his Practice. But as to the particular Laws and Cuſtoms of a Town, becauſe Omiſſions of ſome inconſiderable Cuſtoms, do neither derogate from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Place, nor at all tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Community, there muſt a Latitude be allowed: Firſt, Becauſe many of them may be not only frivolous, but vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and no man can be obliged to ſin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe ſome may now be burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and inſupportable, in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Town, or Corporation, which, when eſtabliſhed, might very well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and no man can be bound to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and unjuſt, to that Society which he is ſworn to preſerve. And laſtly, Many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of a Town may, either after the Oath be abrogated, or by a general Omiſſion nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and withdrawn; and no man can be obliged to ſupport that which has no being, or is voided by the ſame Authority which gave it its firſt being; for it is an old Rule,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43674:59"/>
that, What inſtitutes, may aboliſh. To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Caſe therefore plain and practicable; we muſt diſtinguiſh of thoſe Priviledges and Cuſtoms that are Fundamental, and thoſe that are only Accidental and Circumſtantial. Thoſe that are abſolutely neceſſary to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Corporation, and whole Body, in their Honour, and Power, that is, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to preſerve the whole Community for the ends and deſigns for which it was at firſt inſtituted; you are neceſſarily obliged to the ſtrict obſervation of: becauſe theſe being withdrawn, the Society will be ruined and fall. But, ſecondly, there are ſome By-Laws and Cuſtoms, that, either may be leſs Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, or, only tend to the External Pompe and Grandeur of the Community, and no way neceſſary for the Actions of Juſtice, or Execution of Law: For the principal end of embodying Towns into Corporations, was for the better Government of thoſe Numbers that there uſually ſwarm together, not only for their own advantage, that they might be capable of protecting themſelves, having Laws and Juſtice to defend themſelves from malice, and violence; but that, for their eaſe, and convenience, they might have Juſtice ſpeedily executed upon Offendors. Now this may be done with an Iron Rod, as well as a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43674:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Golden Mace, as well with a Sword, as a Gold Chain, and in ordinary habit, as well as Scarlet; but yet becauſe External Pompe and Splendour of Magiſtrates uſually caſts a dread upon the People, and makes them ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to offend; theſe things, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Wealth, and Dignity, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs of a Town muſt be had a ſpecial reſpect to, leſt the Building decay with the Pompe and Ornament; and in this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, common Cuſtom, and preſent Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the general body, ought to regulate each particular. Now even theſe alſo muſt be diſtinguiſhed, into what are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent practiſed, having already, either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or uſage received their Sanction; and what ſhall for the future be eſtabliſhed: Thoſe that are preſent, are to be obſerved no further, than by probable tokens you can conclude their firſt Sanction and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did intend; ſo Laws are frequently interpreted according to the intention of them, where the ſenſe in the Expreſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dubious. Thoſe that are future to your Oath, which, you are obliged to the obſervation of, if confirmed by ſufficient Authority, muſt alwaies be attended with theſe Conditions; that they are poſſible, that they are honeſt, that they are juſt; for no
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43674:60"/>
Oath can oblige either, to impoſſible, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or unjuſt. And laſtly, they muſt not interfere with any of the Statutes of the Realm: For every particular Society is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to a Power, that is more general, and ſupreme. Thus, though your Town is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately governed by a Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet they themſelves are bounded and limited, not only by their Charter, but alſo by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm; and, conſequently, whatever they act contrary to theſe, is not only <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, but they become reſponſible for their deportment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Superiour, and more general Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. So that any Cuſtom, or By-law, that contradicts any Publick Statute, cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you to the obſervation of it, by vertue of your Oath; not only becauſe your Oath cannot oblige beyond the intention of the firſt Impoſer, but becauſe ſuch a Cuſtom, or By-law becomes evil and unjuſt, it being oppoſite to what you were before obliged to a diſcharge of. But yet finally (to cloſe this Caſe, which would have taken up too much time, had I fully opened it) leſt you ſhould yet think this Obligation (which moſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, that are paſt the ſervitude and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Corporation, are fond of) too much unbended and looſe; You muſt have a care,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43674:61"/>
leſt in any doubtful, or confident omiſſion, the circumſtance of contempt, or ſcandal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it; that is, leſt in your withdrawing from what others think an Obligation, you do act with contempt of that general Society of which you are a particular Member; or when you are convinced, that your omiſſion is ſuch a prevalent example to others, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully poſſeſſed of the lawfulneſs of your forbearance, that they are thereby induced to practiſe the ſame thing with your ſelf, not having the ſame belief, and ſo it becomes a ſnare to their Souls, and a torment to their Conſciences. To conclude this then; He that does faithfully (as much as in him lies) and without ſcandal, or juſt offence to others, endeavour to obſerve the Laws, and Cuſtoms of that Society, of which he is a Member; ſo that he will not, refractorily, and, with his full conſent, violate any thing that tends to the ſupport either of the Being, Juſtice, or Honour of his Corporation, which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced is his duty to perform, in that Place and Station which he poſſeſſes; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours alſo to uſe his utmoſt diligence to be acquainted with the particulars of his duty, does, without doubt, diſcharge a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in disburdening himſelf of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that lies upon him, from his

Authority in the general, but to a peaceable ſubjection to yours in particular: and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am ſo true a Churchman to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſtitution, and conſequently, ſo, great a Lover of Loyalty, that I cannot only with all chearfulneſs obey his Majeſties moſt juſt Commands, but alſo ſubmit to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Miniſters, as thoſe that are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by him, for the puniſhment of evil Doers, but for the praiſe of them that do well; ſummoned thereto by the Apoſtles Argument, for ſo is the will of God.

For you know I am a ſingle man, and ſo can (though not without ſome difficulty) make a ſhift with my Salary; yet when a poor man comes to this place, with Wife, and Children, he muſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43674:63"/>
of neceſſity want Supplies for his Family, unleſs the charity of others relieve him; which, indeed, in the times in which we live, where Iniquity does ſo much abound, is wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too cold, either to heat, or cheriſh. But as to what you would wiſh, though not preſcribe to the Biſhops; it ſeems to me to be a little unreaſonable (unleſs they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think it incumbent in a time of exigence, to abate, for the preſent ſeaſon, ſome Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) to be forced to give their preferments to Market Towns, who are very well able (did not the penury and contracted hearts of their Inhabitants obſtruct and hinder) to encourage learned and pious men, and may methinks be perſwaded to it, eſpecially ſince the benefit of enjoying ſuch a Miniſtry is to be confined to their own boſomes: And the welfare of their precious and immortal beings (of more value than their richeſt Merchandize) are concerned, as to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture felicity.</p>

               <p>No, Sir, nor would I perſwade you to conjecture that ſuch a dependent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is ſutable to the ends for which the Miniſtry was at firſt deſigned by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and therefore the Prieſthood, under the Law, had a particular, although large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, by right, and debt aſſigned to them; and, under the Goſpel, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does, more than once inform thoſe that were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and covetous, that he could claim a priviledge, for ſowing to them ſpiritual things, to have a power to reap their carnal; and that thoſe, who preach the Goſpel, ought to live of ſuch a reward as is due to them that bring glad tidings, which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not improperly ſignifie. For the deſign of the Miniſtry is, not only to be the Publick Officers, to put up the Peoples joynt Petitions to Almighty God; but alſo, in their Homilies, and Orations, to perſwade to vertue, and ſharply to reprove the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners; and by all motives, that may be rational, to dehort from the purſuit and practice of Vice, which they will be tempted to be partial, and remiſs in, with relation to thoſe who are their Benefactors; leſt they ſhould peeviſhly withdraw that portion,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43674:64"/>
which, whilſt pleaſed, and indulged, they did freely contribute. Beſides, the pittiful and ſlaviſh carriage, far below their honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Function, they muſt be guilty of, to thoſe that are their ſupporters and relief; rendering themſelves mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and with their own ſhadow will be apt to darken and obſcure others in their eſteem amongſt whom themſelves are uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant. Add to this, their neceſſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to every humour, and vain deſire of their Auditory; not only in relation to the publick diſcharge of their moſt ſolemn du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but muſt ſometimes accompany them to their very Vices, and can only be witneſſes to what they dare not for their livelihood controule. And beſides all theſe, not only inconveniences, but miſchiefs too, a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent maintenance is never certain, but has ſuch continual ebbs and fluxes, that he can never be at peace with himſelf, but ſo filled with what hopes and fears ſuch an unfixed Revenue can poſſeſs him with, that theſe thorns of the World, will not only render his ſtudies and contemplations uneaſie; but, too frequently, fruitleſs alſo; and his head will be ſo wounded, that is, crowned with theſe, that they ſeem only to be a Prologue to Crucifixion.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Biſhops have Kinſmen and Friends.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>That is a way, indeed, that I did not think of; becauſe now the Multitude have no power to diſſolve a Parliament, nor can the Fanaticks have their will in Election of Parliaments, ſo as to ſway the balance to their own ſide.</p>

               <p>They are ſo; and malicious enough, to watch all opportunities, to ruine thoſe that in the leaſt bear any oppoſition to them: But Corporations ſend moſt Members to the Parliament, and Fanaticks are purged out by a Law; though, indeed, it is to be juſtly feared that in many places as there are Church-Papiſts, ſo there are Church-Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks alſo; and the Aſs may be formidable in a Lions skin, if he has but grace to hide his Ears. But I hope however, if the State of Affairs ſhould command a new Election, Your Worſhip will take a ſpecial care that we have ſuch choſen here as may not only take more care, than others have, of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Town, and the ſupport and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Corporation; but that will faithfully aſſert the Prerogative of the King, and the due and legal Priviledges of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not forgetting a poor bleeding Church,

that, betwixt the wounds of too numerous Adverſaries, is ready to die and expire. For ſhould this Party, that now appear in ſheeps cloathing, through diligence and treachery, obtain their deſire; alas! they would be but ſtalking horſes to the Papiſts, who having catched their Prey, would mount them to ride away with it. I hope therefore that all Towns will remember, that Civil Wars are ruinous, and deſtructive to all Trade and Commerce, that Garriſons fill them with noiſe, and tumult; that Violence and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will neither be advantageous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor Children; nor can it at all be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome to them to become Servants to their own Apprentices; and therefore will elect Gentlemen of worth, when ever the preſent Members ſhall die, or be diſſolved, that know what it is to become Slaves to Tenants; to be arraigned before a Conſiſtory of Elders, and to have a Parſon curſe them by Bell, Book, and Candle, whilſt the Surplice is cut into a white ſheet, for the Gentlemen to wear upon the Stoole of Repentance: But pray, Sir, (if I may not be uncivil to your Worſhip) How can you arrive at ſo much knowledge of the intrigues of that Party?</p>

               <p>An Aſſertory Oath then is, wherein a thing is by ſuch a ſolemn confirmation as an Oath affirmed to be: and becauſe falſhood may be as well in a Denial of what is, as in an Affirmation of what is not; therefore this Oath does alſo include a denial of what is.</p>

But our queſtion now is matter of right, not of fact; and we are to follow Precept, before Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. What eaſe can it be to any particular mans torment, to have a great many more roaring with him?

               <p>I hope Supreme Authority may not only have liberty to wink, but ſleep, when he has both Commiſſioned, and Commanded others, and bound them, with the Oath of God upon them, to look to the general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty, and to puniſh thoſe that play the Truant, and violate Laws in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Authority. Thus does the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd go to ſleep, when (as he ſuppoſes) he has with ſafety folded his ſheep: Thus does alſo the Superiour Commander quietly take his reſt and repoſe, when he has ſet his guards, and appointed to his Army Quarters. The Pilot has given forth his Orders, and the Ship may be in danger, unleſs the inferiour Officers, in their ſeveral Watches, ſteer right, and keep the Seamen from mutiny, or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But you cannot ſay there is ſo much as a Supreme Connivence; ſince the ſame Laws are ſtill in force, and the Royal Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ſufficiently been ſounded through the whole Nation, and the Oath of a Juſtice is ſtill the ſame, attended with the ſame force, and Obligation.</p>

I cannot conjecture Fanaticks to be the only
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43674:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Criminals, whom the Laws, you are ſworn to execute, reach, no more than thoſe were the only ſinners, whoſe bloud <hi>Pilate</hi> mixed with their Sacrifice, or thoſe on whom the Tower of <hi>Siloe</hi> fell: But yet, I think, they are as great as any almoſt within the compaſs of Chriſtianity.

               <p>Then Conſcience (according to your definition) cannot prove an exact Rule; and conſequently cannot be a ſufficient Plea for Action. Indeed, according to this, the moſt impious Blaſphemer, and uncontroulable Sinner might make an excuſe for all his Vices, by affirming his Conſcience led him to it; nor could we well blame the Turk for his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43674:81"/>
daily Worſhip to his affected Mahomet, nor the Pagan for his Veneration of Idolls: Nay; the very Jews would have an incomparable excuſe for their bloudy butchery of our Lord and Saviour; ſince St. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us, they did it through ignorance, nay, the very Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers too; and they therefore Crucified him, becauſe they deemed him an Impoſtor. For, certainly, according to this falſe, though common, notion of Conſcience, there is no action, though never ſo impious, or inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but may receive its Sanction, and be juſtified by this Vulgar Law; if ſuch a Conſcience, that conſiſts only in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Apprehenſions, Phancies, Opinions, nay, Thoughts of men, may be not only the Director, but Legiſlator. And if you think my expreſſions do not fully reach what is your import and intent, when any one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes and juſtifies his actions becauſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience informs him of their Equity and Goodneſs; It will be, but juſtice to your ſelf, as well as kindneſs to me, to enquire ſtrictly into your own Notion, and inform your Underſtanding, what you mean, when you ſay your Conſcience ſatisfies you in ſuch or ſuch a thing; and you will find, 'tis no more than your preſent Opinion, and thoughts of what is the immediate ſubject
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43674:81"/>
of your apprehenſion: And if this were to be either guide, or excuſe, then St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before his converſion to Chriſtianity, might have ſatisfied, and excuſed himſelf for all his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt the Chriſtians; when he not only impriſoned this Sacred Off-ſpring, but gave his voice againſt them when they were condemned, compelling them to blaſpheme; Murder and Cruelty might then have been eſtabliſhed by a Law, and it need not at all been a trouble and affliction to this bleſſed Apoſtle, that he was exceeding mad againſt the Chriſtians; for he had the Teſtimony of a Fanatick Conſcience, in that he verily thought with himſelf, that he ought to do theſe things contrary to the name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Acts 26.9.</p>

               <p>Really, Sir, it were no difficult adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtorm all thoſe wooden Forts which that Stoical Author has built in his diſcourſe; though he had an whole Foreſt at his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe, out of which he might ſelect his Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Only I perceive the firmeſt trees were either too tall for him to lay his Axe to the root of, or elſe ſo well fenced with ſharp briars and thorns, that at firſt touch they pricked his fingers, and frighted him from a farther acceſs.</p>

               <p>Verily, Sir, not a few of them are, by moſt perſons that are intelligent, ranked now amongſt the wild beaſts of the Foreſt, and therefore they may delight in the Briars; but thoſe Debates have ſuch overgrown prickles, that they are too ſharp for their heads to encounter, or their teeth to bite off: though we know they have a long time had the Whetſtone, and therefore may take the advantage to ſharpen them.</p>

               <p>Truly, no leſs than an Iriſh Saint, although at preſent an Engliſh Pilgrim; and yet, for all, becauſe of the great affection our ſober Reſpondent ſtill retains for Leeks and Onions, the Gods of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (becauſe they formerly ſeaſoned their broath, with which they baniſhed the mode of that which he, almoſt at the end of his diſcourſe, calls Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge) St. <hi>Taffee</hi> becomes the better Saint: And were it not for fear an Iriſh Footman might be apt to encounter a Shentleman of <hi>Wales</hi> concerning the Superiority of their Guardian, I would adventure more than a few Leeks, and a piece of toſted Cheeſe, that the Iriſh name will prove, at long run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to great a word for ſuch a ſober anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to pronounce in a breath.</p>

               <p>Not only that I may ſatisfie the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſire of the ſober Reſpondent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not, by a Private Conference, anticipate the Reply of our learned Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, who, being a Latitude man, as his Antagoniſt hints, is beſt able to incloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. Though I cannot but, under the Roſe, inform you, that the Dialogue has

met with ſome prickles, and the ſober An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer does now and then rage with madneſs: But whoever was the Author of this Reply, he ſeems to be a better Textuary than Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, though he has got the Aſſemblies Annotations by heart: and has their ſenſe upon all occaſions as exactly, as if he had at firſt influenced them: And to me ſeems a little unjuſt in that he is angry with all Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that do not come from <hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> names only ſome few Authors, and for reaſons refers you to the ſale of his Books.

But that which I would deſire your good Worſhip to note, is, that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer is guilty of the ſame fault (unleſs what is a fault in another, may become only a failing in him) in taking the Debate by the wrong end; witneſs thoſe great pains he has taken, in turning his Concordance, that he might effectually prove what the Debate does not, and perhaps the Author will not, deny, about the Holy Spirits aſſiſtance in Prayer, Chriſtian Experiences, Pious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the abuſes whereof are attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to be rectified, not the uſe totally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, the excreſcencies and abſurdities only pruned, but the Trees not digged up by the Roots: which the Anſwerer has every where miſtaken, (through ignorance (perhaps) cannot be ſuppoſed) as if the Author of the Debates denied the exiſtence or uſefulneſs of the things; which even we poor Country Sots (how ignorant and droniſh the

And when he attempts the vindication of the four great Letters of his Brethrens Names, he uſes the ſame act of fallacy as young Sophiſters do with a Text of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when they would force him to ſpeak his Adverſaries Language, or reconcile him to the Doctrines of that Philoſophy he endeavours to refute; they unite all by a diſtinction or a Figure, when that aged Philoſopher deſigned a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaning. Thus, like an Archer, does he firſt fix his own mark, and then ſhoot his Darts at it: and yet, notwithſtanding his enlarging it at pleaſure, I find he has not alwaies hit the White; or if he did, it was ſo weakly, that the Dart made no impreſſion; from whence I conclude, that though the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be well bearded, yet it wants a ſharpe head.</p>

               <p>I am afraid, Sir, I honour it more than it really deſerves, in mentioning of it to a Perſon of your Worth and Grandeur; or reflecting upon it in our private diſcourſe: For its Author has great reaſon to fear that no body will trouble themſelves for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reply, leſt they ſhould only ventilate the Air, and encounter ſhadows; or go into their Studies only that they may catch flies. For alas! the Debates are ſuch ſtrange Forts, that they can neither be ſtormed, nor undermined, though we cannot ſay but that they are good at both; yet brazen-faces muſt be the only Canon that can poſſibly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43674:88"/>
diſcharge with ſucceſs againſt them, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of plain matter of fact; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer himſelf has no way to decline it, but by the ſame Synecdoche, which is the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his Adverſary. The greateſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph that the Anſwer moſt boaſts in; and the principal Trophee that adorns the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, is, where the Debater is ſuppoſed to come too near to the ſacred Confines of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity; and the Author would fain have the Act of Oblivion to daſh out the memories of Mankind. 'Tis very like, though the Tragical Hiſtory of former Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would not have been baniſhed the World (too much ſpread to be now recalled) yet had not the later actions of the perſons whom <hi>N. C.</hi> does include, too much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced to Loyal Subjects, that former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods were ſtill remembred, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again to be rendered practicable; their crimes might have been forgotten with the puniſhment, and an innocent obedience would have drawn a white Curtain over the reddeſt Characters of their Faults: But when we ſee Tumults and Schiſm ſtill propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to Poſterity, why muſt not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bear the puniſhment of their Fathers, when they react their Parents ſins? And when they are travelling in the ſame way in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43674:89"/>
which their Anceſtors rode Poſt, why muſt it be a violation of Charity to conjecture they are attempting the ſame journey? 'Tis true, indeed, their pretenſes are, like the Title to the Anſwer to the Two Debates, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and peaceable; but their Actions are, like the Book it ſelf, full of biting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring: and you know who betrayed his Maſter with a Kiſs; and who it was that complained of his Enemy, that the words of his mouth were ſweeter than Butter, but War was in his heart; his words were ſofter than Oyl, yet were they drawn Swords. I cannot Conjecture what this ſober anſwer was wrote for, unleſs it were to juſtifie that Expreſſion which the Conformiſt, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, draws from his Adverſaries Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; that as there is a ſanctified wit, ſo there is alſo a ſanctified ſcurrility, and that Scripture Phraſes are ſafeſt to expreſs Satyrs and Sarcaſmes. When your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall view the Book it ſelf, you need hardly put on your Spectacles, to ſee the ſame drolling and jerking that you feel in ſome other diſcourſes; and what was written in ſmaller Characters in the two Debates, in the Anſwer you ſhall meet withal in the Text. Whoever were the Author of this Reply, I find that (in their own Phraſe) he has the Spirit of Government upon him;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43674:89"/>
and could not be leſs (ſurely) than the Head of a Houſe, when the Author of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates was a poor Scholar, he makes him ſuch an inconſiderable freſhman; and yet ſuppoſes <hi>B.D.</hi> to be his Title: which is more, I doubt (excepting a little Commencement by grace) than ever the Anſwerer could preſume fairly to amount to: and 'tis not the opinion of a few, that a Batchelour of Divinity, that does his exerciſe, is a better man than a Cloke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag Doctor; whoſe Learning, ſometimes, that entitles him to his Degree, is ſealed up in his Mans Portmantle. But let the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bater be as poor a freſhman as his Antagoniſt can either find, or make him; I am ſure he has more ſalt in his Pottage, than is to be met with in that pitiful punn, in <hi>pag.</hi> 265. of his Adverſary; where from <hi>W. B</hi>'s Meſs of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he infers, that he has not only <hi>Jus in re,</hi> but <hi>Jus ad rem;</hi> an unlawful quibble, and illegitimate off-ſpring (even according to the Maſters of Wit) becauſe two Languages, ſtrangers to each other, are coupled together, to accompliſh its generation. As for that pride and paſſion that he is willing to caſt upon the Author of the Debates, his own Pen was ſo charged with it, that his Book has ſhot it back upon himſelf; where, as if he had been at <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge, and looked
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43674:90"/>
through the new Invention (that ſo much magnifies that ingenious Society) upon both his own, and his Parties, worth; he has raiſed Mole-hills to ſufficient Mountains, and ſtretched himſelf to a proportionable length, magnifying their heads to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Giants, when their brains will hardly give your poor Vicar ſo good a meal as thoſe of a thin waſted Tythe-Pig. You may, perhaps Sir, have heard from a perſon that was lately in your company, that it was (not long ago) ſpoken of ſome perſons in the World that they magnified only <hi>culices, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, &amp; ſeipſos;</hi> he might have applied it to the very Anſwer that I here privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon: For verely I never ſaw any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of his Adverſaries Circumſtances, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with more diſtance and loftineſs (though ſtill declaiming againſt Pride;) but I ſee their old Maxime is propagated, of hating the name, and doing the thing. Thus do we hear, ſometimes, a perſon, heated with Paſſion or Drink, ſwear by the Higheſt, that Swearing and Drunkenneſs will undo the Nation. But the only thing I am troubled at is, to find a man of ſuch moderation (which, I know not whether in obedience to an Apoſtle, he is willing to make known unto all men) in the Head of a whole Party
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43674:90"/>
as diſtant from his Principles as his ſeeming readineſs for a compliance. Becauſe there are ſome ejected Miniſters (that have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the old Cauſe and Principle) in, or about, <hi>London,</hi> that are both peaceable and learned, that boldly harpe upon gracious Connivences; does it thence follow, that all are to be complied with, that cannot be ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by that Character? 'Tis like the beſt of them are picked out to be a guard to that great City, where the Anſwer pretends (in all its canting and whining complaints) to be both their Magazine and Exchequer. But ſure I am, that your Worſhip knows too well, that there is ſeldom Learning, and more rarely Peace and Modeſty found among thoſe Cattel we have to deal with in the Country: The Heads of Factions being, for the moſt part, proud, though illiterate; ſtubborn, and diſturbing, though neither poſſeſſed of gifts, or graces; no, not ſo much as in thoſe orders which the ſober Anſwerer's Judgment has allowed (though we know not what intereſt and rendring a Party nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous may make practicable.) However here, your Worſhip knows, that men are advanced from Journey-men only to Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, or Tailors, to be Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; take Degrees without an Univerſity,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43674:91"/>
and Commence Miniſters, without ſo much as the approbation of one Lay Elder, or the leaſt Limbe of the next Claſſis: Nay, the very Coblers themſelves preſume to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Laſts. Let not that ſober An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer then ever deceive your Worſhip with a Synecdoche, and caſt a Figure that he may get us within its Circumference; for then he will eaſily comprehend and catch us. But I had almoſt forgotten one thing, that, being ſpread over the whole book, cannot but offend your noſtrils; and that is a Box of Oyntment, with a dead Fly in it; which he having, by conjecture, daubed the two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with, preſently cries out, the Books ſtink; but, upon peruſal of the whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I perceive the Author has had alſo a lick himſelf, which made his breath, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Book, to ſmell of it. He accuſes the Debater for that he has intermixed a little folly, in commendation of himſelf, when he was before a man of great reputation both for wiſdom and honour. Though I think this was ſucking poyſon out of Flowers; yet do I not perceive, by the Flies buzzing about mine ears, whileſt I have the ſober Anſwer before me, that its leaves ſhine with the ſame Oyntment: Do I not ſee both the Author and the Party varniſhed there, both with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43674:91"/>
Learning and Piety? Do we not hear how patient they are in the midſt of ſufferings; how chaſte they are, now they are married, in oppoſition unto Batchellors who have no Wives; how contented they are with never a Living, when their own folly and ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhneſs threw them out, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> I thought once, by his ſimilitudes, that he had been a Phyſician; but by his Oyntment I perceive he would be a Chyrurgeon. Sir, had this perſon (whoever he be) modeſtly reproved the miſunderſtood faults of thoſe Debates, and not been infected with his own reproof, you and I, that before honoured his perſon, with ſuch reſpect as he pays to the Author of the Debates might (out of love to his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) have covered his failings; but ſince his own application may be applied to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Turpe eſt doctori, &amp;c.</hi> I cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thoſe Vices in another, which, I am convinced, I ought to mortifie in my ſelf. Dialogues muſt have ſome Complements, though the ſame perſon is <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to both; becauſe they repreſent perſons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers circumſtances and humours: But for a man to boaſt of himſelf in a continued Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the Anſwerer does) would make even an old man bluſh, and <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf to become louſie and ſhrug. The other part
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43674:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this learned book (coſting him, as he ſaies, ſix weeks in writing, if he has not miſtaken weeks for daies) bathes all its leaves in tears, in which perhaps there may be ſome ſalt, (however they were alwaies their beſt ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory) enough at leaſt to ſeaſon our Charity to thoſe that are moderate and peaceable, ſo far as Law and Oaths permit: And I would willingly, out of my poor Vicaridge, (if any ſuch be in a worſe condition than my ſelf) relieve what by reaſon of either their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or practice may not be altered; and wiſh them both Conformity and Livings: And yet the Church (notwithſtanding all their large Stories and elevated thoughts of their own abilities, could they be otherwiſe obliged to peace) is able to inſtruct her own Children, without the uſe of the Aſſemblies Catechiſm; and yet never read ſome bodies Common-wealth to teach them policy for the propagation of Religion: 'Tis true, you muſt expect a whole Peale of Ordnance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in complaints of youth, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, of Pluralities, and Non-reſidence, (though <hi>qui facit per alium, facit per ſe</hi>) which yet, in their own time were extant with an <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> by their Authority, who, for their own ſakes, now decry them: Witneſs the Picture of an old man (ſince
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43674:92"/>
dead) with a great bundle of Steeples at his back, who having diſcourſed againſt Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and his Arguments being retorted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, had nothing but a diſtinction betwixt the Profits and Preſentation to ſave him from his own Sword: But I ſuppoſe that thoſe perſons, even now adaies, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or intereſt have rendred Pluraliſts, if they might but be ſecured of the profits, they would not think it repugnant to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, if the Patrons had the keeping of the Preſentations. And as for that youth and ignorance (ſo much ſtomached, for nothing more probably than becauſe they are not, as in the late times, conjoyned together) we are accuſed of; The Church of <hi>England</hi> could not be charged with any thing more unlucky to the Non-conformiſts than the youth of their Miniſters; when (if recrimination might be pardoned) we need not look back paſt the memory of the youngeſt Prieſt, to hear the little Lapwings crying, which when they were ſeen, had the ſhells upon their heads, and a white liſt round their crowns: And, as if they came only to ſee the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and make their Horſes proceed Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates for their Maſters, upon a ſudden, having put St. <hi>Maries</hi> dull Notes into Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and themſelves in Querpo, became
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43674:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great Propagators of the Goſpel; when their Preachment, all this while, was but only a Chappel Repetition, their Confidence was their greateſt gift, and ſtrong Lungs the grace that approved them. We have not yet forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Triars, that uſed to uſurp <hi>White-Hall,</hi> who, being ſeated near the Banquetting-houſe, and by Preſentation of others, being informed of the fall of good Livings, would be ſure to make a feaſt for themſelves; and then others, perhaps, might partake of their leavings: How did they make Babes in years preſently to commence Babes in Grace? and then, as if their Seal of Office had been that of the Spirit, they advanced theſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to Junior Apoſtles, and gave them Commiſſion both to plant, and gather Churches: Nor would it be a violation of that gracious and indulgent Act of Oblivion, to remember thoſe pretty tricks thoſe Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones had, by which they ſtarved the old Conformiſts. But I hate to mind your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that which your Worſhip cannot poſſibly forget. And as for the ignorance of the younger part of our preſent Clergy, if the Replier to the Debates did but ſtoop his gravity to converſe with them, he would find them not ignorant of his Devices; and I may confidently affirm without ſmelling to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43674:93"/>
his Box of ointment, that generally, in the time of the ſober mans peaceable reign, there was not the tythe of that learning that now is to be met with in young Divines. It ſhould ſeem, by the grave Anſwerer's ſober handling him, that the Debater himſelf is not very old; and yet, methinks, the wiſe Reſpondents falling upon him, is but like the Limbe of an old decayed and wind-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Tree dropping down upon a ſpiney oak, endeavouring to come up under him; when one would think the greatneſs of the Limbe ſhould cruſh and bruiſe the younger Tree, his own rottenneſs breaks him to pieces. If one would have Old age reverenced, the beſt way is not to deſpiſe Youth; for thoſe that may be young in years, are ſometimes elders in Office. If I had been (in anothers place) at the elbow of this ſober Anſwerer, when his Pen was pouring out this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, with ſo much Gall in his Inke; I would have remembred him, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Biſhop when he was young, and that ſmooth-faced St <hi>John</hi> was the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved: Young <hi>Melancthon,</hi> however, might have jogg'd his elbow, and obtained leave, without prejudice, I hope, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or Party, to have encountred an old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, though he complains he was too hard for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43674:94"/>
him; and though (Mr. Alderman) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo unjuſt to the World as to liſt my ſelf in this number, leſt I ſhould lick up the ſober man's ointment, and what is worſe, anothers praiſe; yet this I muſt tell you of others in the World; that no Church need be aſhamed, when they are numbred amongſt her Officers. To name men would be ridiculous for me, who you know have little other acquaintance than with names in the Tittle Page of a few borrowed Books: And beſides, to name young Divines would be an affront to <hi>W. B.</hi> which very letters the ſober Anſwer has made ſacred; though (if I do not miſtake my information) they make up almoſt his own name. But why do I trouble my ſelf, or you, with what does not much concern us? Old age and Youth may well agree, whilſt the former does not provoke, and the latter does not become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient; If new-built houſes have green Walls, yet old ones are more full of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Let old mens diſcourſes be grave and wiſe, full of matter and experience; yet young ones will ſometimes be accounted good Preachers: both have their great uſe in the Church, and if old Trees are beſt to burn, yet younger are the fitteſt for building. There is, Sir, one charge more remaining, which I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43674:94"/>
cannot but give your Worſhip an account of; and that is, where the ſober Anſwer (as if it would plainly evidence it ſelf a more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Title than the Friendly Debate) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, according to his moderation and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the Debater himſelf is almoſt an Atheiſt, and his Books the grand deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion. If Chriſtianity ſuffers by ſuch diſcourſes, he may thank himſelf, and that wild Party which this ſober man does now head, for being the cauſes and provokers of them, by their Enthuſiaſtical Practices, and enormous Extravagancies. But withal, it cannot but be a Paradox to me, that truth is not eſtabliſhed by the refutation of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; or that the purging a diſeaſe muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be death to the Patient. Cannot the Excreſcencies, or dead branches, be pruned off, without digging up the tree by the roots; or the weeds be taken out of a Garden, without pulling up the flowers too? 'Tis ſtrange (methinks) that Atheiſm muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine Religion, if that which falſly wears both its name and leaves has but a root or two looſened, or its leaves ſhaken off, by a ſmart wind, that the naked limbes and body may appear: Never let us fear that glorious Tree, which bringeth forth fruit unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, and in the end Everlaſting life,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43674:95"/>
will the ſooner die, but revive, and flouriſh much the more for the taking away theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; and when they are grown ſo big and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as to take away the greateſt part of the trees nouriſhment, the pruning-hook will not then pare them off, but a ſharp Axe muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them. But in nothing is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier more unjuſt and weak, than in load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Adverſary with ſuppoſitions of Atheiſm: For this is like the womens duells, who, when they are able to fight no longer, call each other by ugly names; and juſt like a Country-man, or thoſe ſometimes that are more Worſhipful, if they hear an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt or Quaker talk but a ſmall piece of ſenſe, they preſently declare him to be a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, as if theſe were the only Maſters of an Argument: Let not wiſe men run into the ſame ſnare by terming rational perſons Atheiſts, as if they were the only men of reaſon. Some men muſt be drolled aſleep, when Reaſon and Argument cannot ſilence them; and a more airy diſcourſe may be fitter for ſome to breath in, than knotty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and brave harangues; and thoſe, whom Reaſon will not convince may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be jock'd into obedience: Tender Children muſt be rocked in Cradles, when labouring men will ſleep upon the ground.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43674:95"/>
But whither have I run my ſelf into this Book, and given interruption to our farther diſcourſe? I will lend you the Book it ſelf ere long, and ſend for the Anſwer if the Debater will trouble himſelf to reply: By this however I conclude to my ſelf, that this Book is not an Anſwer to the Debates, and notable in nothing but the greatneſs of its Adverſary.</p>

               <p>Your Notion of it, Sir, is in this fully expreſſed ſutable to my meaning; and indeed it is no more than a practical under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and opinion of things, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are; for it can be no other than the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our knowledge, gained from God's revealed will, to the things which we think, ſpeak, or do.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But how can this Doctrine of Conſcience accord with thoſe various Titles that Divines

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vic.</speaker>
               <p>That, Sir, proceeds only from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious application of our knowledge. As firſt, when we remember and reflect upon what we have, or have not done, ſo Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſtiled a Witneſs. Secondly, When, in our retirements, we judge ſomething fit to be done, or not to be done; and hence Conſcience is ſaid to oblige, or bind, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate, or provoke. Laſtly, When we paſs Sentence upon our Actions, arraigning them at our own internal Bar, and conclude them either good or evil; here Conſcience acts the part of a Judge, whilſt it paſſes a Sentence of condemnation, or acquittance; and from hence ariſe all thoſe troubleſome convulſions, that proceed from the Arrainment and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and thoſe raviſhing joyes that ſpring from the benefit of an abſolution.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I need not enquire now for the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence deſigned, that thoſe, who plead the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of Conſcience, againſt Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Laws of the Land, by this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their very vices conſciencious; that they have (I ſay) no conſcience at all; becauſe their diſobedience to the higher Powers, in aſſembling in Numbers larger than what the Laws allow, does not proceed from God's Word, at which the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43674:98"/>
Candle of their knowledge ought alwaies to be lighted, if they intend to plead Conſcience for their Actions. And therefore, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhall not permit ſo frivolous an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ſcare me from my duty, into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and damning ſin of Perjury.</hi>

               <p>Really, Sir, I have made it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to caſt away ſome of my vacant hours, in Society with theſe men, on purpoſe to underſtand their humours; and I have not only found, that, when times were to them proſperous, they were as inclinable to thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are now admired, as moſt of thoſe which now run to the utmoſt extremity (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours do it in the face of the Sun, and they were wont to ſecure themſelves by the ſilence of their company, or ſecreſie of the place; for that may be done in a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle which is not to be enterpriſed in the open Market, and there is no iniquity in a Tribe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> though the ſame Actions are to be condemned in the <hi>Canaanites.</hi>) But I have obſerved moſt of their Religion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the defects of their diſpoſition, and the accompliſhments of their minds, to be, for the moſt part, the diſeaſes of their bodies: Unleſs where ſometimes intereſt, or malice, ſummons their abilities to uphold a Party. Thus will they account that man's
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43674:99"/>
heart humbled for his ſins, whoſe head is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed to lunacy and madneſs; when Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Fury boiles over, in ſcurrilous and railing Phraſes, and Expreſſions, 'tis nothing but the godly heat of Zeal, which, fire was brought from heaven to enkindle; when a Preacher has an unuſual dulneſs, and is fain to groan, to make a Parentheſis, to fill a wide Chaſm in his diſcourſe, this is called Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feelingly; and when want of matter, or barrenneſs of Phraſe forces them to many pauſes in their Prayers, and Lord, Lord, muſt ſtop gaps, and fence incloſures; this muſt proceed from holy Admiration, and divine Extaſie. When they begin their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſoft, and whiſpering, as if they would keep God Almighty to themſelves, with one eye open, and the other ſhut, and now and then a wiſe ſhrug with the ſhoulders, or a white and innocent goggle with the eye; this proceeds from awe, and dread, whileſt they are beginning to be familiar with their Maker: ſome of them wink faſt in their Prayers, as if that Spirit, they pretend then to be ſo full of, would ſteal out at their eyes; or elſe thoſe Spunges would not effectually yield tears, unleſs they ſhould be well ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Have you not ſeen one of thoſe dull fellows make wry faces, like one that has
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43674:99"/>
had an hard ſtoole, and drawn his Sparrow mouth to his ears, as if he expected a freſh prompter?</p>

               <p>Truly, if their Religion conſiſts in ſuch actions, I can aſſure you, theſe are no better. God deliver me from ſuch Juglers in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that can diſgorge nothing but inkle and fillets, that have more length in them, than breadth, or thickneſs.

               <p>Becauſe every man may find, by his own experience, that when, in a melancholy fit, he takes one of their Authors, and reads a little, the Book preſently ſuits with his temper, and he is pleaſed then with thoſe Gourds and Muſhrooms, that a bright Sun preſently withers.</p>

               <p>And yet this is what they alwaies did, when they poſted their dreams for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Viſions, and made their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (as they called them, when they were but the effects of their preſent temper, and diſpoſition of body) ſigns of trial, and marks of ſacred ſcrutiny and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>I do not make an univerſal concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor is any Rule ſo general, but that it admits of ſome Exception; yet it is a ſhrewd Character by which you may diſcern thoſe of that Party which believe what they hold, and are ſerious, as well as zealous in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.

                  <hi>Well, Sir, you have fully ſatisfied me in this particular, concerning the Conſcience of thoſe men, againſt whom my Oath, as a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace, obliges me to put the Laws in execution; for I am ſatisfied that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment is not according to the Scripture Rule; and therefore they cannot, in reaſon, plead Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for their actions; ſince a mans opinion, or judgment of things, is not an Argument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive enough, to juſtifie his Principles, or his Actions, and Deportment, that flow from ſuch a corrupted Fountain. But they pretend to the Spirit of God, and that they have a ſecret te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the unlawfulneſs of our preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and ſervice, and the legality, and juſtice of their own.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>I am very joyful, that your Worſhip is apprehenſive of the reaſonableneſs of the former Point, and that your Conſcience is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43674:102"/>
ſatisfied concerning it ſelf, as alſo the vanity of their Conſciences that pretend moſt to this Principle. And indeed, for the moſt part, a Fanaticks Conſcience (if a Tradeſman) is his Cuſtom and Gain, if a Teacher, honour and maintenance, and a ſatisfaction of his eager humour of Paſſion, and Malice. And as this Plea of theirs will, to the reaſonable part of mankind, appear empty and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: So, from the very ſame grounds upon which their Conſcience is refuted, ſhall I alſo manifeſt, that their pretenſes to the Spirit, and that ever bleſſed and ſacred teſtimony, is no leſs a cheat alſo.</p>

               <p>The firſt is then, if they have the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Holy Spirit, for the Doctrines that they deliver, and the Actions which they practiſe, then their Sermons had been Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and their Actions infallible: and thus might not only the Deity it ſelf be made a Liar, and men be metamorphoſed into all theſe ſtrange and monſtrous ſhapes by a Law, that has Heavens Seal for its authority, and inforcement; but Rebellion and Treaſon would become Canonical too; and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth would be out of courſe, Peace and Charity be perpetually diſturbed,

               <p>Becauſe, Sir, we have no other aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of Scriptures, which are the Canon and Rule of Life, but becauſe the Spirit of God has given its Teſtimony, not only by inſpiring their firſt Publiſhers, but by Miracles that are without the power of Natures attempts; and, by this Teſtimony, out-dated the Law, which was before eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, by the ſame Sanction: therefore if other Doctrines might have the ſame Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I ſee no reaſon but they muſt become Canonical, and of the ſame Authority with the Scriptures themſelves; ſince thoſe were but the Doctrines and Writings of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired; to the truth and confirmation of which, the holy Spirit gave its Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and thus paſſed them into Canons and Rules.</p>

               <p>That, Sir, proceeds from their peeviſh Principle, not to be ſatisfied with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; for, if you call to mind their former methods in his late Majeſties Reign, they were never ſatisfied with his largeſt Conceſſions, 'till they forced away both his Crown and Kingdom; the continual grant of any Petition, being but an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to frame another; one Conqueſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the Prologue to another Tragedy: and when they began to unveil the Temple, and touch its Roof, they never put a period to their work, as long as one ſtone was left upon another.</p>

Yet, at your deſire, I ſhall mention one more amongſt a multitude of abſurdities, that naturally flows from this ſtrange Doctrine; and that is, that we muſt be continual Scepticks in Religion, and our way to heaven, will be as uncertain as the wind, or as our own dreams, or conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>

               <p>Since various complexions are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temperaments, and the manners of the mind do too ſtrictly attend upon the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of the body, it muſt needs be, that, according to the variety of faces and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the operations of the mind muſt not only be diſtinct, but divers: Thus as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe the object differs according to the diverſity of thoſe Organs it makes its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions upon; and whatſoever is received, is introduced according to the capacity of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43674:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
recipient; ſo will it be in relation to the mind; this will either be guided by ſenſe, and ſo the motions of the underſtanding will be as fluctuating and uncertain as the vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a trembling or ſhaking ſenſe: or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Education may prove the only ground of belief, and then our Religion may be as vain as our Education either looſe or Fanatical; or elſe capacities (admitting an equality of perfection in rational ſouls) may be exceeding different in the proportions of their extent, as well as the manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and reception; the Images of things, in ſome brains, being lively and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, make more exact perceptions of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; in others, being more obſcure, broken, and crumbled into ſmaller Fragments, and diſeaſes and indiſpoſitions of body making too great a ſickneſs in the minds of men, had they no other Rule than what they conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture a motion from the Spirit, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or guide their opinions and actions; every phanſie or conjecture that men were poſſeſſed of, that made any laſting impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the mind, would preſently become a rule and guide to Religion; and thus not only would there be as many Faiths almoſt as there are Judgments in the World, but as many Religions as men: Nay, every man
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43674:108"/>
would differ from himſelf, and change his faith as often as either the temper of his body ſhould ſuffer mutation, or, the figures and ſhapes in his brains be changed, either by the introduction of new objects, or mutiny and diſorder of the old Images in dreams, or diſeaſes: Add to all this, that divers waies do converſes, intereſts, and other accidents, make ſtrange impreſſions, and mutations on the minds of men. And as you will ceaſe to wonder at that variety of fanſies, which men, that eſpouſe ſuch uncertain directors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, not only cheriſh, but vent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate; ſo you will ſufficiently perceive the great deluſion of thoſe that thus pretend the Teſtimony of the Spirit to raiſe ſtorms in their own brains, and then ſay that this wind blows: Thus making the Spirit of God, to whom we owe our everlaſting bliſs, as far as the indictment of Scripture conduces to it, not only the Author of variety, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>

               <p>I cannot, Sir, obſtruct your belief, any other way than by perſwaſion, and argument: But certainly you cannot poſſibly make a more viſible diſtinction betwixt us and them, than they make betwixt them and themſelves: For they are different from each other even to a ſeparation, and therefore the divers Sects have their divers Teachers, and pretended Miniſters; their Doctrines and Modes of Worſhip are divers, their Churches (as they call them) and Communion diſtinct: only in their civil converſe they are ſomething more courtly and complemental to each other, than formerly they were.</p>

               <p>Alas, Sir, that may be ſmelled at a diſtance, and ſeen almoſt by a blind man: You know, ſimilitude is the foundation of affection and friendſhip, and there muſt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43674:109"/>
be a Fitneſs and reſemblance in the bodies, or ſome ſimilitude and likeneſs in the minds, where a League of Friendſhip and amity is ſtruck: There muſt be a conveniency betwixt the perſons to ſatiate each others longings and deſires, and to accompliſh the end that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Now theſe divers Sects, that ſeparate from our true, though dejected, Church, have ſome reſemblance and ſimilitude in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of their Principles, and can diſcourſe altogether in the ſame mournful, and ſad tone, and canting phraſes, of ſome things that they all agree in; and in their different Tenents, with a wary caution with thoſe, among them, which are moſt politick, or at leſt with a ſeeming pity and compaſſion; which the advantage of their lamenting ſpeech gives a great countenance to: They are alike alſo in their complexions; for an hatchet face, and a dejected eye, with a white Cap, to make the head diſeaſed, when the body is well, are things that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all to imitate; and a ſneaking deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Hermophrodite garbe, are more ſure ſigns of theſe men, than any their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers uſually lay down for them to know which Party they belong to: Add this too (which more cloſely unites them) that there is a ſimilitude in their ſeeming affections,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43674:110"/>
being all condemned by one Law, all ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Act of Uniformity, all ſubject to the Penalties of thoſe Statutes that concern Conventicles, and unlawful Aſſemblies: Nay, laſtly, if you reflect upon this, that they all agree in the dearly beloved ſin of Rebellion, watching only an opportunity of revenge, you will not wonder, that they, who are ſo different in ſome Principles, ſhould yet be kind, and hold a more ſtrict correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with one another: For they well know, that one Party of them muſt in vain attempt, either by diſputes, or force, to ſet themſelves at liberty, and bring us into bonds and ſlavery; and therefore they will unite all their Forces. Beſides (finally) by this feigned union of theirs, they would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſet us a pattern of Toleration for them; ſince the Presbyterian can now accord with the Independent, and Anabaptiſt; that ſo our Charity may be as Catholick as their Rebellion.</p>

Supreme Power from executing the Laws, by the Club Argument of their power and force; and when thus they have aſſaulted us with amazement, and fear, will they attempt to do that by rebellion, which I hope they will never effect by entreaty, to put Swords into ſuch enemies hands, and be the Authors of our own execution.</p>

               <p>Yes, why not, as well as they have done? But becauſe the reſolutions of men, in affairs of this nature, can only be known by their Letters, and Diſcourſes, the other Parties dare not truſt them with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or management of ſo cloſe and bloudy a deſign: Beſides, they are aſſured, when

               <p>I hapned once where a Quaker and another perſon had a verbal difference, and after their manner proceeding to a diſpute; the Quakers Antagoniſt asked him whether he would be true to his Principles in relation to the enduring blows from another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtriking again?

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43674:112"/>
the other perſon, doubling his ſtrength, almoſt felled the ſturdy Quaker; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoked by the ſmart and pain, thought he had ſufficiently obeyed the Text, ruſhes upon the other, with this expreſſion, Thou ſhalt know that I have ſomething of the old man yet; and, truly, banged him very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly.</p>

                  <hi>Well then, methought I liked that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe exceedingly upon your laſt abſurdity from Fanatical Pretenſions to the Teſtimony of the Spirit.

               <p>Yes, Sir; if you pleaſe, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this; that through this deluſion the temptations and directions of the Devil
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43674:112"/>
himſelf may be entertained for the whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and motions of God's holy Spirit. For I would gladly know, where impulſes are made Rules and Guides, how the owners of ſuch uncertainties will be able to diſcern the difference betwixt the motions and ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And it would not be unpleaſant ſport, to hear ſuch critical perſons exhibite their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marks and <hi>criteria;</hi> He would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove a moſt exact Enthuſiaſt, fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrinate Mankind, that were able to diſcern different impulſes made upon the ſame ſoul, to cauſe it to underſtand or believe; ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apprehenſion of one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no more skill in theſe matters than I do, there can be but one ſort of action (at leaſt not divers enough for the Patient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh) in the Spirits of a man, the ſame convulſions and percuſſions on the Nerves, by which the ſoul is enabled to underſtand or believe; and as to this, both the action and mode of apprehenſion is the ſame, whether it be truth, or falſhood under the notion of truth, that is preſented to the Soul; a truth of God, or a Diabolical ſuggeſtion: If an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſeems true, it is embraced with the ſame paſſion and affection, as if it were a real truth: And it is impoſſible to make diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction there where there is no difference:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43674:113"/>
What internal ſigns they have who are beſt skill'd in ſuch melancholy Arts, I cannot well conjecture; but ſure I am, that by ſuch uncouth and unreaſonable pretenſions, they may as well receive the ſimilitude of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, as the Angel it ſelf.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But, ſurely, they would not ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their reaſon and intereſt together, as to be led blindfold by ſuch uncertainties, if ſuch dangers and precipices lay in their way; they muſt have ſome tokens, or other, that muſt guide them out of this ſtrange Labyrinth.</hi>

               <p>I know they are good both at ſigns and wonders, and yet I cannot well diſcern what clue they can have to guide them: For you ſee all the various Sects (as numerous as the Graſhoppers of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and as great a torment as all their Plagues) all pretend, with an equal confidence, to the ſame teſtimony, and they never yet could (as I have heard) attempt, with ſucceſs, the conviction of each other, from any inward marks and tokens, that one was deluded with a pretence only of what the other truly had: Nay, Sir, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your ſelf well, from the wiſeſt of theſe perſons, what they mean when they ſay that they have the Teſtimony of the Spirit; and you ſhall (unleſs you have the better fortune) have no other return than this, that they are

               <p>I did indeed expect this Objection, and foreſee the ſtorm; and therefore am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of ſhelter under it: The great Saviour of Mankind, had not only aſſured evidence
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43674:114"/>
of his own Miſſion, he coming from God, to reconcile fallen Man to his Maker, and to aboliſh, what prefigured him, by the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel of Peace: But the Father and Holy Ghoſt gave viſible Tokens, and audible Voices, to atteſt this great truth to the Inquiſitive, and then unbelieving World, ſealing the truth of our Saviours great, though to Mankind new, Commiſſion, together with the Doctrines he then delivered, to be the Director not only to the preſent Generation, but future Ages, by Signs and Wonders that arrived at the very height of true Miracles; which being the Broad Seal of Heaven, were ſufficient to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the truth of what they were annexed to; and might reaſonably create a belief in thoſe who either ſaw, or were certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the truth of them: And therefore the butchery and murder, nay, the hard uſage of this glorious, as well as moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Meſſenger, cannot, by all the Art and Reaſon of Mankind, admit of any Plea, or Excuſe. And then for his Apoſtles, and thoſe Primitive Martyrs that ſacrificed their lives to give teſtimony to their Maſter's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Doctrine, and ſealed the truth of their Profeſſion and Religion with their own bloud; ſince the Apoſtles received our

               <p>Could ours indeed prove their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for what they ſpeak and do, to the diſturbance both of Church and State, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite unto Law, as well as the Apoſtles did their Inſpiration; and confirm their Doctrines by Miracle, we had ſufficient reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and ſhould certainly ſin, in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to the Spirit of God, ſhould they be puniſhed for their Belief or Actions: But becauſe not only their pretenſions are vain and frivolous, and they cannot give a rational evidence to Mankind of their inſpiration; and their Doctrines, which they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh under this pretence, do not only tend to the undermining Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unſettling Foundations, but, in moſt of their differences from us, both in Faith, and Diſcipline, nay, to the very Phraſe and all, has, by the ingenious Author of the forementioned Dialogues (the Books I ſent you the other day) been proved, not only to be canting and childiſh, but impious and different from that Doctrine of the Goſpel which is to endure 'till the general Flames and univerſal Period, and conſequently ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percedes all expectations of a future Law, or new diſcoveries of what is not contained

               <p>Truly, if they ſhould pretend any ſuch thing (as I know not what their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not confident enough either to expect or affirm) we muſt endeavour an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with <hi>Hocus Pocus's,</hi> for fear one of their tricks ſhould cheat us; and make alſo Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical enquiries into the ſtrength and power of natural cauſes; and take time to conſider the matter well, with all its attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumſtances, both of the perſon, and means of accompliſhment, whether the Power were laſting and permanent, always ready to ſeal his pretence, and the like. But, to prevent all trouble by this objection, I will give you one invincible Argument, why you need never fear the confirmation of theſe mens Doctrines by Miracles, and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you are ſatisfied of their preſent error, and deviation from the ſacred truths of the Goſpel, you may give them the trouble of the Law.</p>

The reaſon, then, which may ſatisfie you is this; That the Goſpel having its perpetual Sanction, if Miracles ſhould confirm any Doctrine or Action oppoſite to this, the whole Trinity would be impeached of falſhood and lies, which the moſt holy God for ever abhors: And therefore St. <hi>Paul's Anathema</hi> may very well ſilence this doubt: <hi>Though we, or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel unto you, than what we have preached, let him be accurſed:</hi> Which he repeats again in the very next Verſe, to teſtifie the perpetuity of the Goſpel, as well as the vanity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of thoſe that would have perverted the Goſpel of Chriſt; and not only ſo, but to prevent all future expectations, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to ſtop the mouths of thoſe that ſhould perchance be given to change.</p>

               <p>In that, Sir, you will not only ſhew your ſelf both a Friend to Church and State, but you will keep a good Conſcience, void of juſt ſcruple to it ſelf, and offence to others: Eſpecially, when you ſhall well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that this boldneſs of our Adverſaries, ſo inevitably cheats their own ſouls, as well as becomes an occaſion of deluſion to their acquaintance and brethren: For their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to this divine teſtimony, can be nothing elſe but an heightning of their perſwaſions, and making their belief bold and ſtrong, and, conſequently, their Reſolutions and Actions to maintain it confident, and zealous.

of Demonſtration, as by any impulſe or motion they can be imagined to have. How can they diſcover the truth of that teſtimony which they pretend to, and diſcern what the holy Spirit ſeals, from what is but phanſie and opinion, or perhaps a malicious ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion from him who is the greateſt Adverſary to Mankind, and perpetually envies thoſe hopes of bliſs that yet remain to <hi>Adam's</hi> Off-ſpring?</p>

Thus the Rod puniſhing and reſtraining the unlimited propagation of Error and Schiſm, they will, by this, be put upon enquiry after the Truth, and upon a ſufficient view of what they have not yet made a through inſpection into; they may at laſt embrace, with cordial affection, what they now proſecute, and offer violence to

A Religion that is nothing but Shadow, and Phraſes, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that never yet were contented with all the Largeſſes of moſt indulgent Princes; nay, and thoſe too, who, when in power, were themſelves the greateſt Impoſers, and moſt ſtrict in their Puniſhments againſt all that did in the leaſt deviate from their eſtabliſhed practices; and notwithſtanding all their cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confeſſions of their former guilt in this particular, now they themſelves are liable to

               <p>I am troubled, methinks, to find you ſo forgetful of our late miſeries, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may make you the leſs ſenſible of our preſent dangers: Every one, that was loyal to his King, and true to his Religion, felt the ſtroke of their ſeverity and malice. But, to put this out of all controverſie, I will ſend you down a little Book newly come to my hands (which is called <hi>Samaritaniſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed</hi>) that ſhall fully ſilence this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and convince you, from the teſtimony of their own Authors, both forein and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, that are beſt approved by their own Party; that they are ſo far againſt Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any but themſelves, that they affirm ſeverities and ſmart puniſhments the juſt debt to thoſe which they account Hereticks and Schiſmaticks. I have not yet read over
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43674:123"/>
the Book, but, by what I have peruſed, I ſee the Author is of a Publick Spirit, and wounds the Fanaticks with their own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; and becauſe the whole demonſtrates the Piety, Equity, and neceſſity of putting the Laws in execution both againſt Popiſh and Puritan Recuſants, I muſt commend the whole to your peruſal; and it may, 'tis like, prevail more than our preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>

               <p>In their places, and according to the extent of their Laws and Permiſſion, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but they are: For I am ſure their intereſt, as well as every honeſt mans, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned. But 'tis the Temporal Sword muſt cut off theſe Excreſcencies, for we ſee they contemn the Biſhops Courts: And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the method is not ſo natural, for thoſe who muſt uſe Rhetorick, and perſwaſion, to encline thoſe to a cordial embracement of what ſeverity may drive them to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of, to be the prime Authors, and the immediate Inſtruments of conveying to them their Mulcts and Penalties. If the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority would but gall them, we could then have an opportunity to prove Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43674:124"/>
to them, and apply our Plaſters to their ſores; and ſhould have that advantage of perſwaſion that we have when we viſit ſick men, who are then for the moſt part in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious poſture, and are willing to embrace thoſe inſtructions and exhortations that, in time of health, they ſcorned and refuſed. But now, if the Clergy ſhould be made the only Authors of their puniſhments, they would hate the hand that had given them the wound ſo much, that they would not endure them to apply any Medicine to effect a cure; and it would, at beſt, be looked upon as no other than breaking the head, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a Plaſter.</p>

                  <hi>I am not ſo forgetful of your diſcourſe, nor ſo inſenſible of mine own Obligation: But impoſſibility of performance does as well diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me from the engagement of mine Oath, as illegality has voided the bond of the Covenant. It is impoſſible to do any good upon theſe people by the execution of Laws, and therefore in vain to attempt it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>We did, Sir, (when the King was firſt reſtored to the poſſeſſion of theſe Kingdoms, which he had before an undoubted right to) vigorouſly execute the Laws againſt theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons; and we found that our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were always full to very little, or no, purpoſe, and there they would preach out at the very Grates, and diſturbe the ears of all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and gather Conventicles at the Priſon doors.</hi>

               <p>Truly, Sir, 'twas an eaſie matter to give the loſers leave to talk; and by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they ſhould have exerciſed thus 'till they had been weary both of prating and reſtraint: Why did you then diſcharge them, and not conſtantly perſevere in making them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Penalty of the Laws? To ſhew Children the Rod only, and never giving them the ſenſe of its laſh, does but the more harden them in their ſtubbornneſs: Thoſe perſons, when they had felt your Juſtice, and ſeen your Reſolution, would, in time, have been weary of their own ſufferings; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43674:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others would have been ſufficiently deterr'd, by their examples, from future moleſtations of Law and Juſtice, or provocation of that Sword which they perceived to be ſo ſharp and keen. You could not, I believe, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a difference betwixt their carriage then, and their deportment now: Thoſe that now, with confidence enough, deſert our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, were devout, then, at the reading the Liturgy: But when they ſee they may, with impunity, provoke Authority, and contemn Government; they ſeparate then out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of being ſingular, or by reaſon of the leaſt diſobligation from the Miniſter, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps any other in Communion with them; nay, if Authority does but puniſh any one for Vice or Debauchery, away they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately run to a Conventicle, and deſert their Religion to be, as they ſuppoſe, revenged of their Adverſary: Nay, after a little while, we ſhall ſcarce have a Whore carted, or an impudent Scold put into the ducking ſtool, nay, a Drunkard or Blaſphemer ſet by the heels, but, to contemn that Authority that ſentenced them to their moſt juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will preſent themſelves at the next meeting place, that from malice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge they may break the Law in another place, where, by reaſon of the neglect, or
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43674:126"/>
cowardize of thoſe that ſhould maintain its force, and reſiſt the breach, it becomes weak, and eaſily aſſaulted, and overcome; ſince they were beat back by due chaſtiſement from the former onſet and battery.

               <p>Your Worſhip and your Brethren are to have thanks given to you for that, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them encouragement by your lenity and forbearance; when the Laws were ſufficiently valid, and you under the greateſt obligation to enforce and execute them. It is a ſad
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43674:127"/>
thing that men will make ſo many excuſes now, who, to my knowledge, in the late times were ſufficiently active to execute the Impoſitions of tyrannical Uſurpers; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the numbers of thoſe that wiſhed the King well bore a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe Army Myrmidons, than the Fanaticks do to us now. But what are theſe formidable numbers? 'Tis true, they make them appear as dreadful as they can; for every one of them has his mouth full of fire and brimſtone, that they blow forth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon us, and, both in their Writings and Conventicles, make as great a ſhew as poſſibly they are able: But you may ſee by this that their numbers are not ſo formidable as they would endeavour to make us believe; for their Teachers were not ſo very many that refuſed Conformity, and yet you have to every little ſneaking Conventicle, no leſs than five or ſix waiting Chaplains that are maintained, for the moſt part, from what the good women ſteal from their Husbands; beſides, ſeveral of them had Temporal Eſtates, and are wary enough to keep cloſe to their own Families, for fear the Law may reach them, when the others poverty makes them venturous. We were beſt, after a while, run away from a neſt of Snakes, becauſe they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43674:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
put out their tongues; or be afraid of a flock of Geeſe, becauſe they hold out their necks and hiſs at us. Would you, that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but a little diſcountenance theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating Companions, and diſcharge your Oath upon the Leaders of the Factions, you would find the Multitude melt and diſſolve like Snow againſt the Sun, and we need no longer be afraid of Tumults and Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But, admitting their numbers to be great and inſolent, I cannot imagine how the execution of the Laws becomes impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Are they become ſo ſpiritual, that they are inviſible too? Or do not their bold Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks often enough walk the Streets? Or is not a Serjeant in Divinity ſufficiently known, when he has alwaies the Formality of his Coife on? Is not the Law ſtill the ſame that it was; have you not the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and way to execute it, the ſame Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Power to attend you? Had you ever yet a prohibition from your Superiours, that might diſcharge the Obligation of your Oath? Did not the Houſe of Commons, with their Speaker before them, petition his Majeſty to ſet forth his Royal Proclamation, to command you to execute the Laws in force againſt theſe Meetings and unlawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? And does not your Oath, that is ſo
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43674:128"/>
ſacred and ſolemn, that, when wilfully negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and openly violated, muſt inevitably bring eternal vengeance upon the contemners head, yet remain obligatory in the higheſt? Though no man can be obliged to an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet a Promiſſory Oath muſt bind him to the utmoſt of his power and ability: And can you ſay that you have acted to the utmoſt of your ſtrength, or according to thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and opportunities that are daily put into your hands? If not, never conjecture your Plea of Impoſſibility will be ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your negligence and indifferency.</p>

Now when my judgment tells me that the execution of the Laws will more tend to the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our peace and quietneſs by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and diſturbance of theſe perſons, than the forbearance; certainly I am excuſed from the Obligation of mine Oath in that reſpect.</hi>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43674:129"/>
conjecture that the executing the Laws againſt Conventicles and unlawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies will at all diſturbe, but very much ſettle, the peace and tranquillity of the Kingdom: For their numbers are not yet ſo great, but that they may with facility be ſuppreſſed, without any breach upon our preſent quiet; would the Juſtices of Peace lend their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Command their Conſtables and inferiour Officers to ſeize and apprehend the principal Actors, that they may be brought to the Bar of Juſtice, to receive their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and condign puniſhment. For ſubſtract but the number of women and children, that are uncapable of reſiſtance, from the total ſum of theſe bold Uſurpers, and Violaters of the Law; and abate for the want of ability of ſome, by reaſon of their Age, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of courage and reſolution in others; and we need not fear the power of the reſt, there will remain ſo inconſiderable a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be encountred with: Finally, add to all this, that they are, for the moſt part, perſons who are inconſiderable in their intereſt, being Tradeſmen and Handicrafts; ſo that, if their Drum ſhould beat, and their Trumpets ſound ſedition and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, it could be none other than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to their final deſtruction. But if
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43674:129"/>
none of theſe Pleas could poſſibly with any reaſon be made, you are not, in your Office, to be a Judge of what is a mean to promote or continue the Publick Peace; for your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is not proper in this cauſe, unleſs you were a Privie Counſellor; but the Laws, you are ſworn to, are to be your Director, and, unleſs you receive a prohibition from him who has the Supreme Executive as well as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power of the Kingdom, your Oath (whatever may either through fear, ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or indulgence to others be pleaded to the contrary) will oblige you, upon no leſs danger than the ruine of your ſoul, to do what in you lies to diſcharge it.</p>

               <p>Methinks your Worſhip is juſt like a perſon quite ſhipwracked, you catch, with ſuch greedineſs, at every little Planke and and Oar; and I hope I have almoſt vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all your Arguments and Doubts, and hewed down the main Pillars of the Houſe, you do ſo prop up your building with Poles and Faggot-ſticks: Do you not yet conſider that the welfare of your ſoul is to be preferred
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43674:130"/>
before not only your Eſtate, but your Life too? <hi>What advantage is it</hi> (that I may put to you our Saviour's Queſtion) <hi>to gain the whole World, and to loſe your own ſoul?</hi> This is ſo precious a Jewel, that it is not capable of barter, or exchange: All your torment for the gaining of an Eſtate here, is only to make your Poſterity rich: and what benefit can you reap from their temporal welfare and proſperity? Your body will lie rotting in a grave, and that Vault will be too obſcure and dark for you to ſee through, and take a proſpect of your Families ſplendour. There cannot poſſibly be the leaſt reflection, from their honour and advancement here, upon you, when lodged in your bed of earth, and crumbled into Duſt and Vermine. And then to have your Soul eternally miſerable, and to ſalute your body in fire and flames at the great and glorious Morning of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe you have neglected your Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations here, both to God, your King, and his holy Church, only to ſecure your preſent Poſſeſſions, or to heap up Riches for future Generations; this is relinquiſhing the higheſt Heaven for a poor contemptible ſpot of Earth. Methinks, Sir, you ſhould be better skilled in your own Trade, than to exchange the Pearl of preat price, for ſmall, contemptible, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43674:130"/>
periſhing Commodities; to barter Diamonds for <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſtones, and with the Indians, to to ſell the fineſt Gold for a ſmall piece of painted Glaſs. If the ſevereſt Duties, and ſtricteſt Obligations of moſt ſolemn Oaths, may thus be diſpenſed with, when Intereſt ſtands in competition with them; we then certainly never yet underſtood our Religion, nor is the Goſpel of our Saviour the way to Heaven, nor will the Gates of that glorious City be ever opened to the Practicers of Chriſtianity. For if we make a narrow ſearch into thoſe eternal Precepts of the great Author and Contriver of our Religion, as well as Redeemer and Purchaſer of our lives and ranſom, we ſhall find, next to a belief in our Saviour, that they conſiſt in mortifying our Appetites, Paſſions, and Deſires, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing our Affections from too eager a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of this World, in a bleſſed contentation with our preſent Lot, that turns Earth into Heaven and Paradiſe, in a due and conſtant obedience to our Superiours, a ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Promiſes and Vows, and there muſt not be with us yea and nay. 'Tis a wonder to me, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be blamed for denying his Maſter, if any intereſt might diſpenſe with duty; or that the Primitive Martyrs had not been more wary, than to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43674:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
burn their bodies, when they were no accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice. Our Saviour, I am ſure, was obedient to the death, and has aſſured thoſe of their unworthineſs of himſelf, or any of thoſe advantages that he has brought to an ungrateful World, if they love their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons better than himſelf. Believe it, Sir, God and Mammon, Chriſt and Belial cannot both be ſerved and obeyed; and if you will obey the Commands of one, you muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſlave to the other. I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that a perſon of your Port and Gravity would once mention ſuch an Objection as this, that ſets a Temporal Intereſt againſt a Spiritual advantage, as if it were ponderous enough to encline the balance both of Faith and Reaſon. Shall a great and ſolemn duty be neglected, to which you are obliged by the bond of an Oath, in which either your lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or contempt execrates all your own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and abandons your everlaſting bliſs, only for the Pelf and glittering Duſt of a ruinous and tottering World? This is making a God of Mammon, proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the Golden Image, and adoring a pitiful lump of clay. But what ſhould I argue thus with a Chriſtian? You are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and therefore have renounced the World, as well as the Fleſh and the Devil:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43674:131"/>
and therefore I hope this Objection ſtarted from you through weakneſs and inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy only, and was not the effect of Judgment or Premeditation; nor can you conjecture that Private Intereſt is of that concern with Almighty God as to be potent enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe you from the leaſt duty, much leſs from the great and moſt ſtrict Obligation of an Oath. And yet, that I may endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate all Evaſions, even to thoſe that may not have ſo deep and prevalent a ſenſe of duty, You know by reaſon of my Reſidence and Function in this Town I am acquainted with almoſt all ſorts of Tradeſmen.</p>

               <p>They tell me then, that indulgence of the Juſtices to Fanaticks does not at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Cuſtome, or ſupport their Trade; nor will any Obligation engage thoſe men to buy any where but there where they may have the beſt bargain: And that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me to a belief of this, is that prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous covetouſneſs and Jewiſh griping that I have obſerved in the moſt of them, as if it were riveted in their very Religion; for they pretend abſtinence to ſave the expenſes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality and good neighbourhood, and ſo become, in their way, religious only that they may ſave charges: Nor can I at all wonder
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43674:132"/>
at theſe mens avarice, as long as they have ſo much of pride and humour to maintain: So that as your intereſt and livelihood, were it concerned, is not enough to weigh down your duty and Oath, even that cannot be much damnified by your Juſtice and Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe perſons: For ſomewhere or other they muſt buy, and if your goods be moſt merchantable, and beſt cheap, you will not fail of theſe Cuſtomers: If not, all the art and skill that you have, all the favour and kindneſs you can ſhew them, ſhall never be arguments prevalent enough to draw them into your nooſe and ſnare: For there are no perſons, under the Canopy of Heaven, that are better skill'd in the arts and tricks of cheat and couſenage than themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will eaſily diſcern the little wiles that you lay for them.</p>

               <p>Truſt God Almighty, Sir, with your Eſtate; he will never bleſs you the leſs for the performance of your duty: For <hi>if you be willing and obedient you ſhall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the Sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> Iſa. 1.19, 20. Truſt, Sir, in God and do good, and you need not doubt of being ſufficiently fed. Not only the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church, which is as glorious as it is great, depends upon your activity, courage, and diligence; but even the King's honour, and the Kingdoms proſperity: For if Laws, that have received their Sanction, are not put in execution, it muſt be for one of theſe three Reaſons; either becauſe they are imprudent and unjuſt in themſelves, and this will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Legiſlators wiſdom: Or, ſecondly, becauſe he that is to put them in execution has not power enough to accompliſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and then, his force being contemptible, fear and dread will be withdrawn from the Subject: Or (laſtly) becauſe there is a defect in his will for the accompliſhment of what his Power is ready to aſſiſt him in, and the Juſtice of the cauſe enforces the Obligation of the duty: and either of theſe Reaſons
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43674:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being granted, and believed amongſt the multitude will immediately lay a Kingdom waſte, and reduce Empires into heaps of Ruines: For a Prince being thought to want wiſdom, brings his Perſon in contempt; want of power in time raiſes his Adverſaries, and defect of will to reſiſt and withſtand them, encourages them to proceed to victory and conqueſt.</p>

               <p>I ſee, did not your Oath goad you, the welfare of the Church and peace of the Kingdom would ſcarce prevail. Shake off, for once, all your fear, and do not love the honour more than the duty and burden of of your Office: And then I will tell you that never any Party yet would plead for Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but whilſt themſelves were under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; they had another note when the Sun ſhined, different from what they have in a ſhower. To my knowledge Toleration was accurſed in their mouths, who now thank God for a gracious indulgence. The late times will afford you teſtimonies enough of their tyranny, when they wore the Sword of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43674:133"/>
Power and Force, and we ſhall aſſuredly find their actions contrary to their ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhould Rebellion ever be rampant to a victory. Do but read over the Books I lent you, and tell me then what hopes you have of an indulgence from them, unleſs you once more turn to their Principles and Opinions. But that I may uſe a Reaſon that muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſilence this Plea, ſhall we ſuffer our ſelves to become the conquered Party, only that we may experience the civility of our Adverſary?

Church. And it cannot but be a ſtrange piece of Policy for a Prince to permit the invaſion of his Territories, and ſacrifice both himſelf and Poſſeſſions to the Avarice and Malice of his cruel Adverſaries, that they, wanting an Enemy to encounter, may ſheath their Swords in one anothers bowels: To be ſure they will not diſagree as long as they have a Common Adverſary left alive, and it will be ſtrange pleaſure for a dead Enemy that his Adverſaries rage againſt each other. I hope, Sir, your Arguments are all now ſpent: for the Veſſel I perceive is out, by the dregs and Lees that run from it. Let me now with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, beſeech your double care for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of what has been, to our ſorrow, too long neglected; and let a true repentance, for your Omiſſions, be evidenced both to God Almighty, and the World, by your future vigour and Activity. The Night has now blotted out the Day, and calls for a period to our Diſcourſe: The Laws will prove your beſt Director, and your Oath and Duty the greateſt Motive, Let the gaping wounds of a bleeding Church beg your Charity to bind up the ſores, and the devaſtation and miſery of former Wars, and almoſt total ſubverſion of Chriſtianity amongſt us, beſeech your endeavour to ſupport that Church, which a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43674:134"/>
warm Sun would ſoon revive, and a ſovereign Balſam quickly cure: That your duty to God may be faithfully diſcharged, and the breach of Oaths may not burden your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; That you may prove both an obedient and loyal Subject unto him who gives you your Honour and Authority by your Office, a faithful Aſſertor of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Power, and Supreme Prerogative, a ſtout Champion for the Church's Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, a juſt Fence to Propriety and Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and a charitable Repairer of thoſe breaches that Schiſm and Sedition have too long made upon us. So ſhall you be a true Fence to the Fold of Chriſt, preſerving the encloſed from the mouths of Wolves; and be a means of reducing thoſe wandring ſheep that, through giddineſs or wantonneſs, have ſtrayed, out of their appointed Paſtures, amongſt the wild beaſts of the Foreſt. And God Almighty direct all your undertakings, and crown your Pious and Chriſtian endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with ſucceſs; that your courageous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and ſacred Promiſes may never ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate or be envalidated, through the ſubtilty of the Adverſary, or allurements of the World, 'till your unwearied Performance publickly teſtifies, that your Promiſe was not raſh, nor your Oath in vain.</p>
